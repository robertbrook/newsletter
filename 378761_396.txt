"Where delicious molds are discussed." - well, I suppose you could put it that way.

Editorial is great. Drafts is great. I'm still using Nebulous Notes.

I like John Siracusa. I like Merlin Mann. I like Gina Trapani.

Still thinking. I like thinking.

I'm warming to these New Buses. I still think riffing on the Routemaster was naive. We should have more faith in new ideas. The Routemaster is fine, but why just rewrap that design? It's nice inside, I think.

As you know, I'm no coder, but I do like getting into it and chipping away at specs and features.

A couple of people have asked about my 'URLs idea', which I should mention now because it's hardly even an idea - and it's also hugely underwhelming. I wanted to 'blog' just with a list of URLs, which I'd run a script over and generate stuff from each URL automatically. It's even sadder than it sounds.

My little script is called 'rotor'. I'm not entirely sure why. I wrote it in PHP, then Racket, now Perl. The one thing I remember about Perl still holds true: it's fast.

This Bootstrap responsive navbar is killing me. But, I won!

Everyone was hyped about this iOS 7 design update, but no-one seems animated by any new looks in Mavericks.

Merlin's talking about 'quantified self'. I still don't really get it. I mean, I understand what it means, but I don't understand why.

I have "24,999" contacts. I'm pretty sure that's not right. Apple's Contacts application is dreadful. I use Cobook as the contacts UI - and I'm throwing Contacts Cleaner at the horrible thing now. Fingers crossed. I blame iCloud. Oh forget it. I don't have time for this. Ridiculous!

Thanks to Liz Conlan for reminding me of Cult Pens, which I shall presently be buying from.

The iOS7 SDK - or whatever it's called - has functions for detecting if people in photos are smiling, or blinking. Amazing.
