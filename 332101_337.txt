Now, I'm no cyberpunk. Neither am I a goth. But I do have a soft spot for the stories of H. P. Lovecraft. I read most of his stuff years ago - and I'm rediscovering it now, in podcasts.

Reading a file as a stream makes the data available as soon as chunks of it are ready and lets you pipe it through other streams too." A very useful and understandable run-though of the node.js filesystem library.

Vincent Price, in 'Angel Street' - the 1938 play which gave us the term "gaslighting", being "a form of psychological abuse in which false information is presented to the victim with the intent of making him/her doubt his/her own memory and perception".

The type faces used in the maps of 'National Geographic'. And now I have a title for one of my stories: 'At Dasoune'.
