What if Apple stopped making Macs? I mean, what if they went to iOS and away from MacOS entirely?

Ian Hardy, writing for the BBC, in a surprisingly fact-packed article on tagging and desktop search. I like the photo of Ironic Software's Tom Andersen. #chinposin

Flickr is starting to look like Delicious. And, in a way, Twitter. They're all converging.

David Weinberger: "A decade ago, metadata was all the rage among the geeks. You could tag, geo-tag, or machine-tag Flickr photos. Flickr is from the old community. That’s why you can still do Creative Commons searches at Flickr. But you can’t on Instagram. They don’t care about metadata." This is from David's response to a talk by Anil Dash on 'The Web We Lost'. I want to write more about this.

I realise it's heresy in some places, but I really didn't get into the graphic novel 'Saga'. For me, it didn't hang together. The script felt uneven. It's probably just me.

There are places you could work where failure to deliver value would matter. Most places are like that. But the are also places you might be working where failure to deliver value would not matter - where other things are regarded as more important. Not many places are like that, but there are places like that. You might be working in a place like that right now. The rules are different there. Again, I need to read this and think more.

I still thing 'From Hell' is the best graphic novel I've ever read. It's graphically violent, but worth persevering with. I preferred it to 'V For Vendetta' and 'Watchmen'.

"... A foppish piano prodigy with a moustache, who dreamed of writing Broadway musical comedies and spent his free hours in robe and slippers, smoking Benson & Hedges Menthol 100s and hunching, vulturelike, over his piano, plinking out show tunes about doe-eyed ingénues who'd been seduced and ruined by caddish millionaires." And later: "A month before I was scheduled to fly to England and resume my career as a facile ignoramus, I came down with a mild summer cold that lingered, festered, and turned into pneumonia, forcing me to spend two weeks in bed."

I'm still looking for the 'American Vampire' volume 4 in paperback. Have you seen a copy of that anywhere, perhaps?

"... a simple library for creating guided tours through your app."

I'm going to read my book now. Have a lovely day today.
