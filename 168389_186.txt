Can I get the Drafts iOS app to read from a different Dropbox folder? I mean instead of just /apps/Drafts? We're drifting into iCloud territory here. I can't see how iCloud is going to survive longer without an "all your files" view, even if they don't end up giving us iDisk back.

Time Machine says it will finish in five days. Dropbox says it only needs four. Something doesn't feel quite right.

Could someone rewrite this for appnet, please? I suppose I should try that myself ...

... well, not just me then. I wonder if I can push text straight from Safari to a Mac app.net client. That would be nice. I had a look at the code. I could try, I think. Looks like it's written in Coffeescript. So, learn some Coffeescript. Can't quite understand the hosted bit yet, but it looks possible.

If I do things that make me unhappy, or stay in an environment that makes me unhappy, I can't expect to be happy. I suppose. Hardly a revelation.

I've been thinking about teaching and instruction a lot recently, trying not to use scare quotes. I'm not a teacher, or a manager. I do my best at whatever it is I do. Well, I try to. I'm not great at instruction, or telling anyone what to do. Thankfully, I'm rarely required to do that sort of thing.

But I have been helping out older folk with computer and web stuff. Should I be offering choices, or making choices for them? If I know one thing would be better that another, I should just say that, I think. Sometimes I want just to restrain myself and wait until someone asks a direct question, to which I should try to give a direct answer.

One useful method I've discovered, for me, is one question at a time - one answer at a time. Look, it's not as if I really know stuff. But if I can help, I should help.

I still find myself saying to people "You should have a website" and then realising te only reason they're telling me anything is that I'm not on Facebook to see what they write. "You shuld have a website" doesn't really mean anything any more.

Like John Siracusa sort-of said, computers are never fast enough. More links tomorrow, I promise.

If you don't like looking inward, why not look outward?

Have a good day.
