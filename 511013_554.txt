I still don't understand how people shave in the shower. I always need a mirror.

I was listening to Merlin Mann talking about 'firing a client'. I think this means that you're working for someone, then the relationship doesn't work, then you have to end the relationship. I couldn't really think my way through that, until I realised that this had to be a 'short-call' working relationship, rather than a longer contract. That's right, isn't it? Presumably you'd be able to break a contract as well, under certain circumstances. There would probably be costs, but it always have to be possible.

I stopped using webscript.io - it's a hosted Lua service. I think it's great, especially the feature which allows you to load code from Github. I mean Lua libraries, hosted on Github. That's fantastic! I stopped using it because the web interface, where you can edit scripts, didn't work very well on an iPad. I'd strongly recommend taking a look.

I'm thinking about writing about web views: I made some notes earlier but I can't quite remember what point I was trying to make.

No, of course I won't fill in your incredibly long and complicated Surveymonkey thing.

"Grab this entire site as a free, self-contained, ready-to-run VM" - that's so cool. I mean, I know this is normal now, but it's still impressive, right?

I really like git and GitHub.

"The write API is designed to be used by public bodies to create their own requests in the system. Currently used by mySociety's FOI Register software to support using Alaveteli as a disclosure log for all FOI activity at a particular public body."

Onwards.
