John A. Wilcox discovers an interview done with Gerard Langley, in 1991: " I got into pop music when I was about 13. It took over from football - soccer that is - in my life. Since then it's a major part of my life. I buy 3 or 4 albums a week. I play music all the time. I find the whole lifestyle very simpatico. I was 19-20 when I left college and punk started. Punk was a great time - you could actually be in a band. Before that the musicians had bands. I never even considered the possibility of being in a band. It never even occurred to me. Then suddenly you not only could - you had to."

Slang at Oberlin: 'Cat cookies', 'Fussers', 'Prospie', 'The Rat' ... I'm a big fan of local slangs. We should have more.

"WHAT IS COMMON SENSE AND HOW DO I USE IT?" ... "People are also more apt to being gullible or confused by the text of others displayed on their screen. It is very important when you feel these exaggerated emotions to take a deep breath and think."

Very warm in London. I had a shave. That might well have been a mistake. I have a lot of mail to reply to, still. I will reply to it all.
