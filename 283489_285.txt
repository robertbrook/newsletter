'What Would Tilda Swinton Do' is a question I shall ask myself more often. Contains light swearing.

My two favourite Iain Banks books are 'The Wasp Factory' and 'The Bridge'. I read 'The Wasp Factory' when I was lighting a play, somewhere. I remember taking every spare moment to open up a paperback. I think that particular book stands apart from his others. 'The Bridge' I still enjoyed more, though almost half the book was lost to me due to the dialect. It's a great book, really. I never got into his science-fiction books, though I know many people who admire them.

I'm still trying to sort out a post-Tumblr tumblog. I'm pretty sure it'll end up somewhere near Fading City. Should I keep the longer posts separate, or perhaps not?
