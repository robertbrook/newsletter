Via Gary Cook. Patrick Leach: "Remember, you don't have to be a connoisseur... to shop here. You can be a wirehead, a metalhead, a zipper-head, a propellerhead, a deadhead, a cokehead, or even a knuckle dragging oaf, just like me, to shop here, as long as your dinero is green."

Something is up, here. Might we be seeing a tumbling renaissance? I'm really, really enjoying this.

I used to read Faisal's stuff a lot. But then, I used to do a lot of things a lot, a long time ago. This is his presumably ancient page renderer. I still like these things.

I'm currently running my own hacked version of this, with the files being written to Dropbox and read with a Fluid app. Internet is serious business.

"Tragically, when a company finds itself with Innovation Debt and various stakeholders are calling for a detailed Product Roadmap, or the engineers finish up their current project, and there is a need to feed the beast, then there is a big risk that proper product management principles will be thrown out the window, and the highest-paid-person’s opinion (aka HIPPO) will determine the next product or features that are built."

I miss going out.

Tito Gobbi on Desert Island Discs: his favourite disc of the eight was of himself, in 'La Montanara'. His luxury, a bar of gold.
