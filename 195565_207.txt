Today it is an irregular publication dedicated to the editing of Tolkien's manuscripts describing his Elvish Languages. ... It has no ISSN or ISBN number. Parma Eldalamberon is sold on a per-issue basis only, it is not found in bookstores."

"Here we show that four days of immersion in nature, and the corresponding disconnection from multi-media and technology, increases performance on a creativity, problem-solving task by a full 50% in a group of naive hikers. Our results demonstrate that there is a cognitive advantage to be realized if we spend time immersed in a natural setting." Science, right?

"There is no idea, however ancient and absurd, that is not capable of improving our knowledge. The whole history of thought is absorbed into science and is used for improving every single theory.
