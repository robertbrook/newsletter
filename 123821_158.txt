Do I miss Twitter? Honestly, yes. A bit. Sort of. Sometimes. It is a pity that being on Twitter is pretty much being visible online, now. I certainly miss the people. But! There are people in real life, apparently. Will I go back to Twitter? No. In fact, I'm not even sure I'll survive much longer on app.net. The push from the paged web to the streamed web is something I have opinions on, but I'm not sure how I fit into it, if at all. I'm thinking of the whole 'indieweb' idea in particular now.

Is there a definitive list of content sources for BERG's Little Printer? I think these are just the first few that were available.

"Better sleep [through] two tablespoons of organic almond butter before bed, ice baths one hour prior to bed, and half military crawl position." Merlin would hate this.

Swiss railways decide to follow the UK example. "... the formal payment for my ticket from my credit card company arrived four minutes after my train left the station. That means, they say, that I bought my ticket on the train - and that is not allowed. Together with the letter was a fine for 190 francs."
