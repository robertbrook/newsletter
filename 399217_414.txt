"We're hard at work, designing Tinderbox for Windows. It's a big project; we'll be as fast as we can!" - you know what, I'd really rather you didn't.

I have a lot to do. That's a good feeling. Please, give me more.

I posted the first part of something about a road in Ealing.

Thanks to a Californian correspondent. Was Morrissey really ever a "heartthrob"? ... 'Chrissie Hynde Bites a Dog' ... not a fan on Julie Burchill ... "I glance around his office looking for an axe." ... "He also says he was offered a part as Dot Cotton’s son" #mindblown

Dave Winer: "My father chose morphine, and spent his last weeks high as a kite, doing nothing, sad for sure, but also able to reflect on his life, and spending lots of time hanging out with people who known him, instead of being an object of the health care system."

"You may have power, position, but at the end of it — what? Please, this is a serious question that you must ask yourself. Another cannot answer this question for you." - Why do people get annoyed when I say I read Krishnamurti?

"One of [Joseph] Campbell's most identifiable, most quoted and arguably most misunderstood sayings was his admonition to 'follow your bliss.' He derived this idea from the Upanishads ..." - I hadn't ever made than connection before ...

... "We're in a freefall into future. We don't know where we're going. Things are changing so fast, and always when you're going through a long tunnel, anxiety comes along. And all you have to do to transform your hell into a paradise is to turn your fall into a voluntary act."

Enjoy today.
