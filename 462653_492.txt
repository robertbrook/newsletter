Wendy Earle: "Museums do themselves no favours by trying to compete with the multimedia attractions of contemporary culture by imitating them."

Via Mark O'Neill. There's can't be that many web pages with the term "interlocking chickens" on them.

John Keogh has a sharp eye for things like this: apps for iOS that may surprise and delight. Thank you again to John for doing the hard work! Here's James Gurney on 'Waterlogue': "I started by taking a photo of our teapot using our iPad. Then Waterlogue started dissecting the image in real time, searching out contours, dropping in blotches of color, and applying watercolor-like effects, such as a wet-into-wet color bloom."

"Obscure Records was a U.K. record label which existed from 1975 to 1978. It was created and run by Brian Eno, who also produced the albums ..." An amazing roster: Gavin Bryars, John Adams, Eno himself, John Cage, Michael Nyman, Penguin Cafe, Harold Budd and more. Thanks to John Keogh for the link as well.

Derek builds his site from a Rakefile. I'm still working on mine, obviously a great deal simpler than his. I like it, though: it just works. Crude, perhaps, but effective.

Sotheby's handled the auction of Navajo blankets collected by Andy Williams. "SALE TOTAL: 978,506 USD" - thanks to my mum for the link. I think Sotheby's originally had it valued for over a million.

I get the bus past this thing most days. There's an 'apartment' for sale in the new tower at Vauxhall for ... wait for it ... £19.5 million. That's a lot of money. You get four bedrooms and a view, I suppose. But still, £19.5 million. Vauxhall. Just by the bus station. And there's a Tesco Metro.

Onwards.
