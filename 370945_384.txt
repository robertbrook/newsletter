Piers Cawley: "I’ve been a Perl programmer for over 10 years, and have written the Perl 6 Summaries for the last 3. More recently I’ve been getting into Ruby; I’m not sure I’ll stay here once Perl 6 finally makes it into the world, but I’m liking it a lot for right now." That's what happened to me: I shifted from Perl to Ruby.

Manuel Simoni: "If you have some great new idea for PLs, you can be quite certain that Lispers heading an Ivy League university's CS dept have already tried it out, decades ago. And if it isn't in today's Lisps, it's because it didn't work."
