"In this month's How To, we will be taking a look at the magical mystery extension from Connectix called RAM Doubler. Yes, we've all heard about it, we've loved it, we've hated it, we've had it work, and had it not work."

Markus Persson on work and life after Minecraft: "While Mojang has its near future sketched out in terms of game development, Persson continues to play around with new ideas and ways to make games. Currently he's been tinkering with HTML5 game development to try and determine what the platform is capable of. ... Persson says that he believes JavaScript is almost fast enough to support the sorts of games he would want to make, but this experimenting remains a personal interest for now. He has no plans to release a game in HTML5."

"The line-of-business manager typically views the systems as support to the business process and a cost to be managed. The IT Architect views the enterprise systems as a set of capabilities that must be progressively modernized to support business innovation. The IT Project Manager is focused on delivering projects to time and cost."

See you tomorrow.
