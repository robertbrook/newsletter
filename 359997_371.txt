And good morning to you!

I was supposed to be writing my airplane story, but it didn't quite take off. I might shift it to a train. After all, I do know more about trains. In the meantime, I'll write about Axminster.

The iOS Flickr app now has filters. Not really much you can say after hearing that, is there. How far we've all come.

"... well you know what they say about pessimists - they jump out of the window and then they're no longer involved." James Burke, in an interview with Eddie Mair

"... until death's flood brimmed up in his heart." Beowulf, Seamus Heaney's translation.

A weird thing just happened and it felt like a part of my brain just folded over. I think I should brush my teeth.

"I can't get a read on him."

Goodness, I feel like the ghost at my own feast.

"My expectations were beyond low."

I'm writing this is Editorial rather than Nebulous Notes, on the iPad. Nebulous Notes has been great, but Editorial seems like it's going to be even better. I can persuade Editorial to preview Markdown as HTML, even if the file extension is .txt - lovely!

Can anyone recommend a UK based Wordpress host?

I'm thinking about "issue validity".

A few people talk to me about stuff they're doing, or thinking of doing, in the next six to nine months. Maybe a year ahead. Most of these conversations have a little element of the adversarial about them: people want to test their ideas. However, there's another group of people who want to talk to me, to be frightened and to disagree. Why? Why bother talking to me at all? Of course the weird thing is that we're most often talking about really straightforward stuff - and it's easy for me to be right. They still want to argue and disagree. So for those people, I'm the person they want to disagree with, even though I'm right.

I was right, dammit.

I wonder how many GMail users are going to feel nervous about this.

A familiar face on High Street Ken, wearing a lovely blue t-shirt. Hello! We really should.

I've got more writing to do this evening and next: half a thousand a day, I'd say. It'll be fine. I just need these drives to back up a bit quicker.

Anyway. Onwards. Have a great day.
