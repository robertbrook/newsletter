Someone is talking about "the AV man". The term AV makes me uncomfortable.

After scuttling around the web yet again looking for a way to get user-entered text into Automator, I discover that Automator has an "ask for text" action. Wonderful!

At least objectivism isn't corporatism.

Presumably for my own physical safety, the works canteen only issues plastic spoons. So here I am, sitting with a rice pudding and eating it like some kind of animal. I may bring my own spoon in from now on.

Print's not dead. It just went up-market. Check out this selection of shiny editions stocked by Albam.

I'm setting up a group Tumblr blog for anything but text. If you fancy joining in, drop me a line. And, of course, it'll need a domain name.

Still getting my head round FoldingText, a text editor for the Mac. It seem to have embedded modes - and extensions are in JavaScript. Needs more playing with.

I've stopped reading about Model 2.

Unsurprisingly florid discussion of how confusing, or not, Ember.js is. Or isn't.

"Most computer programmers tend to make technical decisions based on cliches they read about on the Internet, and unfortunately I don't know the cure for being dumb." Unsmiling headshot. "I tend to design software systems in advance only at the level of the domain. I find that programmers who try to come up with APIs or draw class diagrams ahead of starting to code tend to write very poor code."

Liz Conlan suggests another reason that Apple might not have such an interest in Mail and the Address Book as they have previously: that there are simply more exciting things to do. Shinier problems to solve. Solving hard complicated problems doesn't get you a snazzy page on the Apple website. Remember how Apple billed the BSD underpinnings of earlier releases of the OS? "Oh yes and UNIX."

Libby Miller points me to Toby Segaran's "Programming Collective Intelligence". Some pretty impressive Amazon reviews, too.

Career. "Career". Do people still have those?

Very odd day yesterday. Started positive, went downhill late afternoon, evening difficult.

I discovered something in 1Password recently: I can import whole lists of saved data. Very clever. Despite some odd UI choices, I certainly recommend 1Password.

You'd just end up fretting about everything eventually, wouldn't you.

Have a great day.
