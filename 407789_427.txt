Via Liz Conlan: "Todo lists are tactics. The items differ from day to day. Some might be large tasks. In contrast, Trickle Lists are strategy." - not sure I get this yet.

'The Scientific American Cyclopedia of Receipts, Notes and Queries', 1901: "Because the formulas and receipts in this book are older, fewer modern chemicals are called for, and it is more like a collection of old farmers and craftsmens secrets. This makes it more interesting to the survivalist, the homesteader wanting alternatives to modern methods, and similar persons."

Is a hectograph what I knew as a 'Roneo Machine'?

You know what, I'm just going to go ahead and eat this banana.

"Find out from your employer if he will release you in the event of an invasion so that as long as you are in unoccupied territory you can put in a full time watch." - people had to ask if they might be absent from work if the UK was invaded?!

'Demijohns and carboys' - I heard the first, but not the last. I think of 'carboy' as US English. "Samuel Tobias, an early merchant in Philadelphia, advertised in the Saturday Evening Post in 1829 notifying tavern keepers and the public of his very reasonable prices for his own wine bitters, cordials, catsups, and essence of peppermint. Wine bitters, which Tobias described as a very pleasant and fashionable drink was dubbed 'Red Rover'."

I think I might have said that I was "robertbrook" on Spotify. Actually I'm "robertbrook2013". Again, I'm not sure if that information is interesting or useful to anyone.

"None of the open source Twitter replacements have been compelling enough to attract users. Sorry, it's not justice that determines whether a platform gets traction."

"A second electrical stimulation was applied with slightly more intensity, while the patient was sitting up with her arms folded. This time the patient felt the presence of a 'man' who had his arms wrapped around her. She described the sensation as highly unpleasant and electrical stimulation was stopped."

Enjoy today.
