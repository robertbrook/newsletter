Susannah Clapp reviews Michael Rosen's Brighton Festival: "not shackled to a theme yet together capture the city's particular atmosphere. They are sometimes haunted, sometimes hurdy-gurdy."

Scarves? What's wrong with scarves now?

I listened to Mark Ravenhill's adaptation of this as "Jungle of Cities" on the wireless recently. The whole thing was deeply upsetting, as I suppose was intended ...

... I'm sure by now it's no longer in iPlayer. I look forward to being able to link to iPlayer content for longer than just a few days. It seems more than just a pity that Mark's work is just sitting on a server somewhere.

The reason I don't want to share my opinion so much now is that people just want to tell me I'm wrong. So I just keep quiet.
