Buried somewhere in the stack, something about separating out email accounts. My work account is entirely separated from the rest of my online life. Work email and work calendar live in a box on an upper floor of a building on the Parliamentary Estate. No remote access. No syncing. I used to do that, but now I don't. And I survive. It's a time and attention thing, isn't it?

I don't actually get that much email. A combination of efficient spam filtering and not talking to people. Recently I've have a handful of 'personal' mail sent by CEOs of companies who's services I've signed up to. It's not the follow up mail I object to so much as the pretence that some exec has sat down at their desk to personally catch up with me. Doesn't seem likely.

A taxi stops on Parliament Square. The passenger gets out to take a photo of Big Ben. With an iPad. Okay.

If I hear the word innovation one more time I shall simply scream. And does anyone really thing bringing in some exciting speaker will really motivate a workforce? Did that ever happen? It's not that these external speakers are duff - most of them are fine - it's just that we have no ears to hear. Rows of suits sitting listening to some fantastic story only to return to their desks and carry on as they did before the inspirational story.

Why not think of situations where beneficial organisation change has happened, then trace back to the source? Was it really an invited speaker? And I don't mean organisational change as in we successfully completed that tedious project, but in the wider sense. People are less unhappy and we're doing better work. God, I'm naive, aren't I.

A coment on Reddit: "If you intake more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. If you burn more calories than you intake, you will lose weight." Okay. But. Why am I stuck at 64 kilos? For years? Do I consume and burn exactly the same amount of calories every day? That seems unlikely.

I will never be enough for the world. Does that sound like giving up? Maybe I am. Surrender. My hands are cold and smell of coffee grounds. All there in your hands, isn't it?

"a completely incandescent personality" - a terrible thing to suffer.

I'm trying to make the text-only version look a bit more bearable.
