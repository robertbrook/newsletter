Punky67 asks: 'Is "A Brave New World" worth reading?' - comments as delightful as ever: "This book is a classic."; "Ramble, ramble, ramble."; "This is depressing. I tried to read this. I found it hard to read."; "It's a very pleasant distraction."; "You have to win the peoples' hearts by giving them bread and orgies. Then they'll forget about the hard stuff."

I have a lot of mail to mop up. I need to make a dent in that.

USS Bunker Hill: "Tied up at Naval Air Station, North Island, San Diego, California, in October 1971. Though stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, she was still employed as a test platform for the Naval Electronics Laboratory Center."

Audrey Hepburn: "More than once I was at the station seeing trainloads of Jews being transported, seeing all these faces over the top of the wagon. I remember, very sharply, one little boy standing with his parents on the platform, very pale, very blond, wearing a coat that was much too big for him, and he stepped on to the train. I was a child observing a child. I don't know how much longer it was before we knew what was happening - sooner than you did in Britain."

Enjoy today.
