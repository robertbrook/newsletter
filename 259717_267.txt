I'm slipping back into writing about me, in the past. But, again, write about what you know, isn't that it? I don't know about the future and other people write better about the present. Me and the past is all I have. And even that slips away. And I've not the imagination for anything more.

Via @redmamba: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system." - John Gall ...

... check out some of John Gall's books: "Systemantics: The Underground Text of Systems Lore. How Systems Really Work and How They Fail", "The Systems Bible: The Beginner's Guide to Systems Large and Small", "First Queen: A Historical Novel on the Life of Hatshepsut Queen of Egypt", "Dancing With Elves: Parenting As a Performing Art" and "Hit by a Low Flying Goose". I like "Dancing With Elves" in particular.

Have a lovely day today.
