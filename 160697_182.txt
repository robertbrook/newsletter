I'm trying to shift to a simpler layout. Please let me know if it looks weird. Not that I'm necessarily going to be able to do anything about it, but - you know, I'd try.

Sniffing market patterns and "anti-persistent behavior" with GPUs.

The thing about newspeak was that is was to pervert language. We don't do that now. We just neuter it. "App" now means "anything on a computer that moves". "Edit" now means "anything in the world that is a subset of any of the other things".

iShowU used to be top of the heap for Mac screen recording. Anyone got any better ideas?

There's a difference between the corporate and the person, I think? They can't be that difficult to tell apart, surely.

Heavy on the front-end.

It all comes down to what you take "seriously", I think. Time and attention, as Merlin would say.

On Tumblr too.

Apple is doing a Watson on so many things now, you hardly notice. Check out the latest version of QuickTime Player: it does screencasts.

The chap the other side of the wall has a terrible hacking cough. Must install Hazel on the - er - thing. Soon.

Listening to Gruber talking to Jim Coudal about 2001, in preparation for a viewing. 

This place usually plays dronecore and Finnish death metal, or whatever. Not today, though! We get melodies today. It feels really weird. Oh look: someone on one of those Dell Minis. Talking to someone with a big old Android thing.

I think GitHub should have the URL shortening. Or, rather, page renaming. For example, this page on 'literate CoffeeScript' might be called #litcoffee - I'm not really sure how all that should work. There's git.io as well, of course. Oh dear. I don't think I've explained this very well.

I'm thinking of trying my ridiculous mailing out a PDF idea again. How would that work out? And I have a feeling I might be posting things more than once. Sorry.

"This matrix diagram visualizes character co-occurrences in Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables." I like the URL.

I think I need a rest now. Early up tomorrow.

Of course, there was an answer to my question, which Russell Garner gave me. It's called autocorrelation. Here's an elegant method for doing autocorrelation in Ruby. I get it in general, but I still have to try it out and see it running to really get an understanding of it. I don't think I'm going to manage gnuplot - I might try D3 instead.
