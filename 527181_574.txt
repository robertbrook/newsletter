I should really write about text structures on the web.

"Thanks to Google, I was able to figure out what these words mean, and learn more about how to sound cool at parties. Man, I love the internet."

I installed an instance of OwnCloud on DigitalOcean to have a look at, well, OwnCloud and DigitalOcean. Learning stuff. Wiped that. Now I'm trying things in Docker. Clicking around. If this works I'll be amazed. Wiped. Trying Dokku now.
