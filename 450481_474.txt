474 - AUTUMN - on the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)

At last, it is raining. It is raining, at last. There is something wonderful and wished-for in it.

I'm almost there, I think. I've scrabbled most of it together from various caches.

Now, where was I?

I've seen a few episodes of the BBC series 'Ripper Street'. It's very good, though nasty and violent. Recommended to those without a nervous disposition. Matthew Macfadyen is better in this role than in many he's had before; more nuanced, not such a clumsy script.

Lady Anne Bothwell's Lament: "I dreamed a dream but yesternight / Thy father slain in foreign fight / He, wounded, stood beside my bed / His blood ran down upon thy head / He spoke no word, but looked on me / Bent low, and gave a kiss to thee!"

Brendan Gregg: "Flame graphs are a visualization for sampled stack traces, which allows hot code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately." ... "I created this visualization out of necessity: I had huge amounts of stack sample data from a variety of different performance issues, and needed to quickly dig through it. I first tried creating some text-based tools to summarize the data, with limited success." ...

... and here's Dave Pacheco's flame graphs for node.js. "We believe this DTrace-based profiling support for Node.js will be a huge leap for understanding the performance of individual Node programs in production."

Elmore Leonard, on writing. "Never use a verb other than 'said' to carry dialogue. Never use an adverb to modify the verb 'said'." Agreeing strongly.

Leslie Lamport, "The Part-Time Parliament" - 1998, originally. Keith Marzullo comments: "even though the obscure ancient Paxon civilization he describes is of little interest to most computer scientists, its legislative system is an excellent model for how to implement a distributed computer system in an asynchronous environment. Indeed, some of the refinements the Paxons made to their protocol appear to be unknown in the systems literature."

Onwards.
