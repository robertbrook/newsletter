I'm still trying to sort out a nicer template for this newletter. So it'll look a little better on little screens. I'm not there yet, though.

"The police got quite good. They would even send people along to meetings to take pictures and notes of what was being said, ... They eventually put an officer in plain clothes and on a motorbike to try and keep up. He was able to make some notes but failed to keep up with the suffragettes because he had not been given a bike with an automatic starter motor."

"Having been imprisoned as early as 1909 for breaking windows in Newcastle when Lloyd George went to visit Tyneside, [Kitty Marion] went on hunger strike, and resisted forcible feeding with intense vigour. Barricading her cell door with furniture, she kept the staff at bay until the next day when they managed to chisel the hinges away. On another occasion, when all metal objects had been removed from her reach, she broke open the pillow with her teeth, scattered the contents around, tore up the prison bible, and in the middle of the night, by breaking the glass of the gaslight, managed to set fire to the accumulation."

"David Bird is the author of 108 bridge books, recently overtaking the total of the late Terence Reese. He is best known for his humorous bridge fiction, involving the monks of the St Titus monastery headed by the pompous Abbot, Hugo Yorke-Smith." That's bridge. The card game.

A long day today; see you tomorrow.
