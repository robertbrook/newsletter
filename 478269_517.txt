Morning all.

"On the morning of 15 September [1931], 'Repulse' sailed on time at 06:30, but sailors on the other four capital ships due to sail had already begun to refuse orders. On 'Hood' and 'Nelson', crews carried out the ordinary harbour routine, refusing to put to sea; on 'Valiant' and 'Rodney', crews carried out only essential duties, including the provision of safety patrols and fire guards, and did so without any recourse to their officers." ...

... Charles Ammon: "I suggest that the reduction in Naval pay insisted upon was the prime cause of the trouble that broke out at Invergordon some days ago; also that the very means by which it was implemented, without any consultation with the men or with those concerned was bound to have a detrimental effect and to be adversely received, particularly when one bears in mind that the Government seem to have adopted differentiation as regards sanctity of contract when they are concerned with financial interests and when they are concerned with those whose bread and butter are dependent on their pay."

Christina Patterson interviews: "if Mutter can appear a little glacial, her life and work is testament to her many and varied passions." Perhaps they didn't have long enough to talk, but it feels a rather thin chat.

It's fast and understandable. What a relief.

"I, too, dislike it: there are things that are important / beyond all this fiddle. / Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, / one discovers that there is in / it after all, a place for the genuine." Marianne Moore, 'Poetry' ...

... "Everything I have written is the result of reading or of interest in people."

I'm hopeful that any new version of Tinderbox will be a little more accessible for this sort of work. "But are there strong artistic reasons for using Twine as a game making tool? Twine often has the author's voice come through very strongly because the working machinery of it is entirely constructed by one person and their words, whereas larger games such as the newly released Bioshock: Infinite have hundreds working on the game's thematic message to the player."
