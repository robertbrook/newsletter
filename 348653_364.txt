Good morning.

That last Guess-Who was, of course, Patrick Macnee. He's 91!

Toyota supports a charity by helping deliver 'continuous improvement': "The kitchen, which can seat 50 people, typically opened for dinner at 4 p.m., and when all the chairs were filled, a line would form outside. Mr. Foriest would wait for enough space to open up to allow 10 people in. The average wait time could be up to an hour and a half. ... Toyota made three changes. They eliminated the 10-at-a-time system, allowing diners to flow in one by one as soon as a chair was free. Next, a waiting area was set up inside where people lined up closer to where they would pick up food trays. Finally, an employee was assigned the sole duty of spotting empty seats so they could be filled quickly. The average wait time dropped to 18 minutes and more people were fed." I'm not necessarily a fan of just-in-time or red-thread process planning. But I thought it was interesting.

If you're interested in process improvement, you should talk to Lloyd.

Recently I've been speaking to a couple of people who's "politics" are not in sympathy with my own. Unfortunately they seem to be otherwise nice people. I'm not sure what to do.

I have to say I'm not a fan of the name. This is actually the work of Sacha Chua. I think it's great.

I've often thought of writing something called "If I controlled a budget at work this is what I'd spend it on" but there are too many ... issues.

I don't know many people like Peter Tatchell - and, yes, I do admire him. Some of his views seem almost naive to someone like me, but he speaks directly and he speaks the truth. I think it would be a great pity to wait until his career is over before his effort was properly acknowledged.
