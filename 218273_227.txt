"It's always worth it to learn new languages but would it be a better use of my time to start over and learn Lisp or just learn how to proficiently use Closures in Ruby?"

"Art thou a Magistrate? then be severe:
If studious, copie fair, what time hath blurr'd;
Redeem truth from the jawes: if souldier,
Chase brave employments with a naked sword
Throughout the world. Fool not: for all may have,
If they dare try, a glorious life, or grave." - George Herbert

Models in Ember: identity mapping ...

http://emberjs.com/guides/models/the-rest-adapter/#toc_json-root (http://emberjs.com/guides/models/the-rest-adapter/#toc_json-root )

Funny how quickly these things come and go.

"Lisp: Common Lisp, Racket, Clojure, Emacs Lisp ... a side-by-side reference sheet" - rather wonderful. What's with the full-stops before some of the Clojure things?

If I do ever get round to living on an island, I could try here: the Isola di Tessera in the Venice lagoon. Looks a nice little place ...

... or perhaps San Giàcomo in Pałuo, which also looks delightful ...

... though a deserted island might be preferable.

How many 10k hours do you have left? Me, about four and a half. Which means I can master four and a half new things, apparently. Or at least I have the time remaining to do so.
