"But yield who will to their separation, my object in living is to unite my avocation and my vocation as my two eyes make one in sight. Only where love and need are one, and the work is play for mortal stakes, is the deed ever really done for heaven and the future's sakes ..." - Robert Frost, my resetting.

Jim Aikin: "The way I look at it, music is an unbelievably huge box of toys. You can aspire to dizzying heights of subtlety, or just bang on things as hard as you can. It's music either way. You can strive to reproduce flawlessly styles that are hundreds of years old, and play on replicas of instruments that were in use at the time, or you can throw out all the rules, plug in a computer, and do something that's never been heard before."
