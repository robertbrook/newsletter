I wrote something about the service industry. Like I know anything about that. But I want to write, so I write. Yes, I am still peeved about that URL - but I can't work out how to make it shorter.

Are odd socks now a thing? I've seen one child and one presumably adult person wearing odd socks. Here, that counts as a new trend. I should get some socks.

"If you want to read free ebooks, don't buy the Kindle Fire. Amazon has locked down the Fire to make it hard to get any content to it you didn't buy from Amazon. It is a huge step back in freedom from the Kindle 3. Even Apple has not gone so far as Amazon in locking down their devices. You can easily download and read ebooks on Apple devices using only the standard apps."

"A Thousand Ways to Please a Husband", by Louise Bennett Weaver and Helen Cowles LeCron. The first few pages include a positively creepy set of illustrations, including an almost indescribably odd 'husband' peering at a bonnet. Later, he prepares himself for a pie in the face through a set of windows. A homunculus nearby passes the ammunition.

W.H.J. or, presumably, J.C. Weale on Hans Memlinc, later Memling: "The impellent craving after realism of the materialistic school of to-day is but a perverted form of the love of truth which was the keynote of all medi√¶val art, its cult of the sensuous but a depraved phase of a love of the beauty in virtue and godliness which characterised the latter: the great touch of faith is wholly wanting."

Enough Gutenberging for today, I think. My goodness, what a treasure-store it is!
