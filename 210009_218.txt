... "Imagine if the Newcomen engine were introduced to a world like today’s.  Book stores would be littered with hefty tomes on valve-turning best-practices.  Bloggers would passionately debate the merits of competing brands of valve handle, arguing about which ones might help young, eager valve professionals in breaking yesterday’s twists-per-minute records."
