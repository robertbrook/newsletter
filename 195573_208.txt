There used to be a guy who sat by one of the ATMs near Oxford Circus, yelling something. No, not the one with the megaphone who used to shout at people regarding Jesus as they went into the tube - a bit further on, opposite where Borders used to be.

"The Derby ram is full of life, but we kill him and make his skin into leather aprons that will last 40 years. Winter is cold, dark and hungry and we need the comfort and warmth of others. Good slays Evil and the Doctor brings Evil back to life, or Evil kills Good and the Doctor resurrects Good." Again, again!

It's nice to be back in Flat White on Berwick Street for a coffee and a side of toast. It's like all these places used to be. Young grumpy staff, great coffee, nice music, full of fruitloops. I like it. Round the corner in Milk Bar they know me, talk to me and are friendly. It's weird.

"But we should not assume that, just because we pay a company they’ll treat us better, or that if we’re not paying that the company is allowed to treat us like shit. Reality is just more complicated than that. What matters is how companies demonstrate their respect for their customers. We should hold their feet to the fire when they demonstrate a lack of respect." - via Terry Madeley.

Enjoy today, do.
