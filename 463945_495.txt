"One of the first political tasks for the Greenland Home Rule Government was to withdraw from the EU due to the wish of having full sovereignty over Greenlandic fishing territory but also due to an overall wish of minimizing the direct influence from outside of Greenland.

"Dave’s a bit of a legend. In the early 90s he was a member of Glasgow Techno band State Of Flux who released on JD Twitch’s old label T&B Vinyl. Their first live show was supporting The Black Dog in 1992 at an old Glasgow venue called Industria, and they were also the support at the first ever Jeff Mills show in Glasgow."
