Yi Wang compares Go with Racket ...

I was wondering recently about people who hold views I disagree with, but with whom I can still be friendly. Then I thought about me - I certainly hold views that many people find distasteful, but I rarely share them. Perhaps if people knew what I really thought, no-one would speak to me at all.

Have fun.
