Good morning.

Sometimes the idea that Merlin Mann is right delights me. Often, though, it appals me.

I wrote something about the thing I'm writing.

It's terribly warm. I can't imagine how I'm going to get to sleep.

Charlie Brooker: "Everybody talking at once and all over each other; everyone on the planet typing words into their computers, for ever, like I'm doing now. I fail to see the point of roughly 98% of human communication at the moment, which indicates I need to stroll around somewhere quiet for a bit." Yes, but, but. I feel much the same. But, still.

Alex Wheatle in Brixton. I lived - well, crashed out - on Morval Road, Josephine Avenue, Helix Road and the rather grim Landor Road. I've very mixed feeling about this: some nostalgia for the place I knew in the past, certainly. Is gentrification a bad thing?

Stella Creasy counts the estate agents in Walthamstow. I could do the same just up the hill from here.

Helen Oratore on the development in Belgravia. The very middle of London seems to be a facade for property renovators. Perhaps we're not in a city any more.

I just closed a few tabs of very interesting projects. I just can't get my head around it all. I have my own little places I can understand. The rest is someone else's. Yours, perhaps. #wearabletech

Missing a rather obvious point about e-books - almost all of them are rented rather than owned. And those not rented are dependent on your device working, or some paid subscription, of the whim of some middle-man. Yes, I do read books on the screen. The whole thing worries me. It all seems so temporary.

Writing, writing. Typing, typing.

Lyddington Bede House's inhabitants: "... 12 poor 'bedesmen' ... and two women ..., all free of lunacy, leprosy or the French pox."

I've never heard this word, from 'rubbish-bin'. I should use it in a meeting.
