Still nothing like it, I don't think.

"... in general, companies should make general product knowledge readily available to development teams (and a requirement for certain developers), which will improve the dialogue that composes the software development process." What happened to intranets? And knowledge sharing? And wikis? Somewhere someone must be doing those thing right.

"A project dedicated to the various forms of cheese from around the world." The internet can still be wonderful.

Reinout van Rees on installing a Django stack on different platforms: "All of this is just a big 'sudo apt-get install' .... on ubuntu, but on OSX it is grief." He tends towards vagrant as a solution.

... "The Sachem presided at the far end of the wigwam at the stump with the first and second Sannaps to his right and left. Four warriors sat in front of him as a guard. The Chief of Records sat in the far left-hand corner of the wigwam and the Collector of Wampum and Keeper of Wampum in the right-hand corner. Against the right wall sat the Junior Sagamore with the stake in front of him. Against the left wall sat the Prophet with two scouts in front of him. The near wall, close to the entrance, held the seats for the Senior Sagamore and four braves before him. In the center of the wigwam was the place of council brand where the council fire was kindled, during which time strict order was maintained."

Something else I don't understand ... "a scheme is put in place to ensure that the money is returned into the cash flow". Is this like the Bristol or Lewes Pound? Do they have inflation or deflation?

An amazing narrative history of rock music in Nepal. Not Wikipedia style, but a great read.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Reuss_Younger_Line
"The House of Reuss practises an unusual system of naming and numbering the male members of the family, every one of which for centuries has borne the name 'Heinrich'." ...

... ending, somewhat ignominiously, with Heinrich XLV.

Enjoy today.
