The Pig Hill Gazette is finally alive. It's a Tumblr thing for video and images and that as much as we've thought about it this far. I'd be glad to add you if you'd only drop a line - or something on Tumblr, I suppose. Please forgive any initial glitches: I'm not really a Tumblr expert. I had posted a few images without credits, but I think I should only post stuff with a proper credit. And now I'm tempted to post other things as well.

Does FoldingText have a word count? I'm not sure. Let's Google that, shall we. I'm sticking with Sublime on the larger screen for now. I thing Folding is great - and has amazing potential - but it doesn't feel like something I can use for 'bulk text', yet. It's more for NVAlt-style scratch docs. In a good way, of course. I particularly like the lightweight way Folding handles plugins.

Really remarkably similar to TextExpander. Uncanny.

Twitter Bootstrap 3 work-in-progress.

On Applescript: perhaps they'll beef up Automator and take away the Script Editor. Could be worse. Interestingly, the URL for Applescript Studio points to Automator now. Facespan was fun, for a while.

I'm slowly migrating from Omnifocus to Apple Reminders. To help do this, I wrote a text service called Inbox - it just takes the selected text and makes a new Reminder in my default list called Inbox. Okay, so it's not node.js, but it solves my problem. Omnifocus is an amazing piece of software, but my needs are less.

Reading about Battersea's famous - and infamous - Red House inn. Didn't like the URL though. I'm not going to link to that.

I'm still convinced of the utility and benefit of group action. The Great Man theory just frightens me. Am I frightened of the actions of others? Of course I am! I don't have faith in my own actions without some sort of editing or filtering - why would I trust the actions of anyone else? But then I do trust other people, far more than I trust myself. I envy those who've got their own ideas, even if I don't agree with them. At least they have confidence in themselves. They look at the world and they know what's right and wrong about it. I look at the world and don't see much beyond my own desktop.
