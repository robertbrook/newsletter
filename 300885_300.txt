I'm still not sure about sending out raw text without marking up the URLs, so I'm going to play it safe and carry on marking them up.

Form the BBC 'Arts and Culture Knowledge and Learning Beta': the photography of Vivian Maier. An interesting note on taking photos as square format and cropping down - also that rather sad realisation that the work is already being put into closed archives. I really shouldn't share my views on that. And what's 'BBC One Imagine'?

Did I mention this before? I can't remember. Mongoose is a server available for most platforms that supports Lua 'server pages'.

http://archive.spectator.co.uk (http://archive.spectator.co.uk )
The Spectator archive: "Every page has been scanned and digitised, each article tagged and extracted, so that you can search the whole archive by content, keyword, topic, location, and date." I wish there was a way to see the original pages as simple images, rather than through a popup window.

A record of a ... game of football? 1833, Duns: "The miller entertained them with pork and dumplings and what was of far more importance dusted them especially their hats with flour."

"Motor cars" - they all look a little like hearses, to me. But what do I know.
