569 - GOOGLY EYES - on the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)
Good morning everyone.

"Worryingly symmetrical".

I really admire John Siracusa. I don't have much interest in video games, or in the grand strategy of the computing industry. He's on podcasts where these things are discussed, but that's not the sort of think I have to thank him for. Though I do find it interesting ...

... what John gives me is a sense of humane encouragement. He makes a lot of sense, of course, but the essence of it is that he encourages me to try, where I so often give up. I give up on almost everything and John never does ...

... he's not a genius, he's not an evangelist, he's a person who describes and supports behaviour which is positive and he encourages that in others - without bullying or gripping his pulpit ...

... I've found his clearly-expressed comments useful and cheering. I hope to be able to hear more of him in the future. Thanks John.

If you wanted to stop syncing your 1Password stuff over Dropbox, for any reason, you could do it using local wifi instead. Useful.

Caesare Cardini, inventor of the Caesar salad, which I've never eaten.

I think this is the primary reason I've listened to podcasts: no for the subject-matter, not for a different voice, but for the proof that people can be sensible and that they can persevere.

What's new with Angular. Also: Blogger is really odd.

A crash course. Of course, it's a course in how to crash. I've been playing around with forth again - thanks to my dad for the encouragement. It really does feel like programming a washing machine, or Saturn V. Also, I read do seem to be able to crash forth using forth, inside forth; which is impressive in an odd sort of way.
