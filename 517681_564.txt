On Clarke's Rules: broadly, I agree. There's some details there I'm not alpha enough to enforce, unfortunately. "On time is already a bit late." True, yes, I think so. If you're late, you should apologise, not just state it baldly. Not "I'll be fifteen minutes late" but "I'm sorry, but I'll be fifteen minutes late". Saying sorry is for the other person's inconvenience - you're not apologising for yourself ...

... in a shared calendar situation, it's okay to postpone or cancel or decline without a note of explanation if you must, but you could include a line of explanation. Having a meeting in a shared calendar and just, you know, not turning up - that's not good. No matter how high up the grades you are, you should turn up or say that you won't ...

... apologies of any sort should be direct and succinct, never indirect or effusive. You're sorry, say so and get on with it. Don't apologise if you don't mean it; people can always tell. Of course, mistakes happen, emergencies happen. Normal people will understand and move on. Sometimes your calendar shows the wrong venue - do your best and that's all a reasonable person will expect ...

... if you're in a situation where communications are difficult, or interrupted, or generally flaky - just do your best. Don't panic, don't fret, have another go another day, if possible ...

... and what if you don't want to meet someone at all? I've not worked out an entirely satisfactory way of coping with that. What about wanting to meet someone you've not met for months? I tend to wait for an invitation, since I have a dread of forcing my company on someone. But then the weeks and months go by and I suppose I should have got the message by then.

I'm on a train with the 'Clapham Chasers', a group of runners who practice by running up and down Lavender Hill, amongst other places. They seem very dedicated. One of them has done the London marathon twice, together with marathons in Paris and Rome. Next Sunday is the next Rome marathon, the Sunday after is the Berlin half-marathon. I won't be competing.
