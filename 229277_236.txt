I still look at Twitter now and then. Some people are really nice. In fact, most people are. That's good. That's really good.

Sputnik is a wiki written in Lua with it's own built-in server. Reminds me of Vanilla ...

... a wiki written in Rebol ...

... recently LiveCode and Rebol emerged into the open source world, sort of. I still think Rebol is worth a look.

Another one from Andrew Binstock: "After XML, JSON: Then What? ... Data representation, a seemingly simple problem, is proving intractable as one standard after another fails to deliver what is needed." He suggests YAML. Which seems ... brave. Not necessarily wrong. Just brave.

A very comprehensive post on using Omnifocus, especially useful with the screenshots of personal setup.

A book, called 'How to Boil an Egg'. It's about a bit more than that.

Physics in the game engine Love: it's Lua. This seems like a simpler and more direct route to some of the 3D graphics-heavy promoted IDEs for new users.

Examples of 'Parrot intermediate representation' code, which runs of the Parrot VM.

Programmers should know at least the basics of the language of business. Some simple but useful tips: "Tie everything to the bottom line ... Stats and charts are your friend ... Keep the company fiscal year in mind". Interestingly, "Be a master at speaking with analogies" - this is something I find myself doing a lot, but getting criticised for by the code people. Maybe the business people like it more.

"Aztán elkezdett gurulni, legurult a létrán, ki az udvarra, az udvarból ki az utcára, ottan utolért egy sereg kapás embert s asszonyt, s azokat is bekapta; továbbgurult, ki az országútra, ott szembejött vele egy regiment katona, azt is bekapta. Még ez sem volt elég a telhetetlen gömböcnek."

"While unifying Google's array of confusing communication services may be a good short-term idea for users, the company's long-term agenda may not be as beneficial."

Have a great day. Try to.
