"Itâ€™s an obscenely good time to be a developer. Enjoy it while it lasts." Really? So developers aren't just replaceable cogs? We can't just send someone on a two-day training course? No?

I'm at a software demo. My goodness, this chap's desktop is a mess.

This chap has a great line in batting the speaker's thing. You know, that thing with the mics poking up out of it. A sort of pulpit for the laity.
