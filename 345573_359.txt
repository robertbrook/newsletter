I solved my wake on LAN issues by keeping Bluetooth on and prodding it when I needed to. Inelegant, certainly.

Just a reminder that I'm very grateful for suggestions, comments and corrections. You can mail me at mail@robertbrook.com. Also, if you're not an axe murderer I'll buy you a coffee.

Hover have started selling .io domains. "If your goal is to reach the 4,000 people populating the British Indian Ocean Territory, then youâ€™re in luck!" I shouldn't buy any more domains. And neither should you, most likely.

"'The Ganymede Club' is a science fiction novel by Charles Sheffield" ... "You may be looking for the Junior Ganymede Club from PG Wodehouse's Jeeves stories". Yes, but still, "Humans have colonised the solar system with the help of self-replicating machines called Von Neumanns." This could surely be rewritten in a more Wodehousian style?

A useful rundown from The Russian Wodehouse Society: "When the doctor advises Bertie to live the quiet life, he and Jeeves head for the pure air and peace of Maiden Eggesford. However, they hadn't reckoned on Bertie's irrepressible but decidedly scheming Aunt Dahlia around whom an imbroglio of impressive proportions develops involving The Cat Which Kept Popping Up When Least Expected."

Another Little Printer escapade: this useful Random Wodehouse Quote? Here's a lovely one: "Owing to my having become mentally arrested at an early age, I write the sort of books which people, not knowing the facts, assume to be the work of a cheerful, if backward, young fellow of about twenty-five."
