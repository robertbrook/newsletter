Procopius on the Nika Riots: "In every city the population has been divided for a long time past into the Blue and the Green factions; but within comparatively recent times it has come about that, for the sake of these names and the seats which the rival factions occupy in watching the games, they spend their money and abandon their bodies to the most cruel tortures, and even do not think it unworthy to die a most shameful death. And they fight against their opponents knowing not for what end they imperil themselves, but knowing well that, even if they overcome their enemy the fight, the conclusion of the matter for them will be to be carried off straight away to the prison, and finally, after suffering extreme torture, to be destroyed."

"Digital physics is grounded in one or more of the following hypotheses; listed in order of decreasing strength. The universe, or reality: is essentially informational ...; is essentially computable; can be described digitally; is in essence digital; is itself a computer; is the output of a simulated reality exercise." #spoons

Luciano Floridi: "Informational Realism" - "Sextus Empiricus thought that we are like men searching for gold, or shooting at a target in a dark room: no matter how long the search or the shooting proceeds, it is pointless because in principle there is no way to establish whether any of us has found a nugget or hit the mark." I love this. It makes me feel so much better about things.

Jeff Bezos buys 'The Washington Post'. Craig Timberg and Jia Lynn Yang write: "Bezos has no patience for bureaucracy, and employees are encouraged to put a stop to anything that smacks of jumping through hoops. ... Bezos also disdains the formality of job titles, encouraging employees to work outside the scope of their titles if it helps the company." Hateful URL not enclosed.

"AirDrop is one of the great new features of OS X Lion and later, which provides a really easy way to share files between supported Wi-Fi-enabled Macs without having to connect through the local Wi-Fi network."
