I've swapped out Fantastical for the default Apple calendar. And I've gone back to Spotlight. KISS, right?

One thing missing from this page on Luajit: what it is, in simple language - and why I should use it. I mean, it looks great, but still.

"Let us examine Swierstra & Duponcheel's parser in greater detail, from the perspective of arrows." Haskell feels like a code lab. I think that's fine.

Back to the hacking. Though, I feel a little embarrassed even calling it that.

"If the giant Mac-eating star goat comes, I will be very sad for a little while, but I’ll just go back to Emacs and stay there. In the mean time, when I need to edit a remote file, I’ve probably got the server it’s on bookmarked in BBEdit."

It's my birthday soon. I'll be 41.

From Google: "part content management system, part issue tracking system, and part customer relationship manager", written in Django.

This feels weird. I'm writing something in Ruby, feeling constrained by the data structures, wishing I was in Racket.

Victoria Coren on Rupert Everett: "I won't tell you how the story continues, but please don't imagine that his trousers stay on." I've always liked him.

Having that old, silly thought: it's been done, better, by so many other people, so why try to do it yourself?

https://github.com/rswarbrick/scraperfaker (https://github.com/rswarbrick/scraperfaker )
"A 'fake' scraperwiki that you can use as a drop-in replacement for the real one when developing scraper scripts" - I'm still a Scraperwiki fan.

Laughing at Roderick saying, with Merlin, "We are gifted men."  Laughing with. I love those guys.

I should probably eat something.

I need to hugely expand my repertoire of "things I don't need to concern myself with". The doings of anyone half my age would be a start. Goodness that sounds awful. Hey, well, I'm awful. I am awful. It's probably envy, at the least. I mean, what did I achieve when I was twenty, or even thirty - or even, dammit, forty? Why should I begrudge these young people their brilliant ideas and knowledge and flawless design? Should I be glad, at least glad for them?

Dialling down on the 'news' now. I think that might be an interesting experiment. I'm a little worried I might be backing myself into a corner. Let's just see how it goes.

I think I need to track better what I'm spending on. I'm going to try this thing out.

Anyway.
