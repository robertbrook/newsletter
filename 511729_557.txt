Well, hello there!

Andy Wardley's Badger ...

http://wardley.org/about.html
... "All my synth-based music came out sounding like some kind of bastard hybrid of Jean Michel Jarre and the Birdy Song." ...

... "Badger was hewn from the living rock of the Template Toolkit."

I'm thinking of rewriting that thing in Perl. At least I found out a bit about Coffeescript. But I need something I can grip and bash things with. Coffeescript isn't that, yet.

"Scam artists attached a Lebanese loop device to a bank machine in order to steal bank cards in Clapham Junction." A Lebanese loop device! What a world we live in!

"That's your problem. That's not my problem."

"The drink came under major fire in 2010, as colleges and universities across the United States began to see injuries and blackouts related to the drink's use." Major fire.

Beachballing. Don't like it.

http://testanything.org
"TAP, the Test Anything Protocol, is a simple text-based interface between testing modules in a test harness." Originally Perl, now all the rest.

I'm trying out Scrivener. For the whole writing thing. But I'm still nervous about anything that isn't plain text files, or at least plain text underneath.

So when's Wolfram Language available?

http://okfnlabs.org/projects/
OKFN Labs is wonderful. So much stuff there. I'm going to have to go back and look over each one of these projects.

I'm still trying to properly understand 'web components'. Fascinating, but doesn't this allow everyone to make their own 'blink' tag? Not that I'm judging.

"By adding the iconic class, iconic.js automatically replaces the img tag with the full SVG markup for you, enabling all the powerful abilities of inline SVG."

A phone cover that takes your pulse - amongst other things.

http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html
"The basic idea behind the circuit breaker is very simple. You wrap a protected function call in a circuit breaker object, which monitors for failures."

http://articulate-lisp.com/examples:trotter-walkthrough.html
"The Trotter is an example web spider; it trots through a web page, heuristically determining which links to follow and recursively printing them."

Have fun.
