I think I just have time for tea.

I'm still expecting Amazon's prices to bottom out, or pull up like a dive-bomber. Isn't that how it works? Amazon eats the competition, then there's no downward pressure on prices and no incentive to them to keep them low.

I watched 'The Perfect Storm'. They all died? They all died?! That wasn't fun at all!

Now and then I have a look at my own website. You know, just to check. Imagine my horror to find a Network Solutions holding page. Imagine my additional horror at finding I had no access to the web space. Things started to go seriously downhill, quickly. I was expecting my domain name to expire in October 2014 - that's what whois said - not this year ...

... I contacted my web host, but heard nothing back because I no longer controlled the mail address they had for me. I phoned Network Solutions, which turned out to be a terrible idea. Without much in the way of identification, they offered to release the domain back to me for several hundred dollars ...

... I voiced my concerns, at which I was suddenly offered a substantial discount. To me, it felt like a scam. Regaining control of that domain suddenly turned into an invitation to fax my passport details to - where, who exactly? For a moment, I thought I'd fight. A moment later, I gave up. So, goodbye to all that. A decade or more, but it's a closed chapter now ...

... so I'll have some fiddling about to do trying to make sure I don't lose control of various things tied to my old email address. My new mail address is robertbrook@fastmail.fm - feel free to say hello ...

http://robertbrook.fastmail.fm
... and thanks to the unique way Fastmail is funded - that is, by me giving them money - here's where things will eventually turn up on the web ...

... honestly, I'm glad all that's over. Time for the next thing. Yes, I know it's a first world problem and I shouldn't take it so seriously. But I did find it irritating. Onwards, then. Onwards!
