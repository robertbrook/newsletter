Moloko!

"Lunch"?

MobileMe. A blast from the past.

The last few scenes of Richard Burton as Marcus Antonius in 'Cleopatra', with Elizabeth Taylor, are really good.

Some of Apple's desktop applications have really been left to decay. Look at Messages on Mac OS. Tragic.

After playing with grunt for a while, I'm going back to rake. Rake works.

I still like Brighton. Coming from London's zone two, Brighton is a sun-lit upland. Of course there's problems everywhere - and, as Merlin says, wherever you go you take yourself. But I still like Brighton.

Walking down from the station, it's not as cold as I always think this time of year should be. By March, it'll be far colder than I think it should be.

There's one of those paint your own crockery places here. They have a big plate with a painting of what I think is supposed to be Nigella Lawson on it, with the motto "I didn't have a drug problem! I had a life problem." Fair enough.

I stop for a coffee, the only place here I trust. I can't remember the name. Outside there's a tile fixed to the wall: "Warning: gentrification in progress. There will be cupcakes!"

I'm having a croissant. I suppose I am the gentrification they're being warned about. What coffee are they serving here? It tastes a bit ... it's probably the weather.

Seeing as I'm here, I should probably go down to the sea. It's really quite, compared to the summer. And a slow shuffle back up to the station.

I stayed only a couple of hours in Brighton, but I am glad I did. Back, then, to town.

I have a few things I want to write about that are on the back-burner, because I need quite a bit more time to think about them. Not that anything I write about or thing is complicated, just that I need to reach the conclusions everyone else has already in my own time.

I learned this the hard way: Twitter Bootstrap stylesheet loading order matters.

Screenshots of the 'ZeroBrane Studio' IDE for Lua. I still think the name is rather odd.
