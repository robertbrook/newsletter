"Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
Or say with princes if it shall go well,
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
And, constant stars, in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date."

My dad recommends 'The Life Scientific' with Wendy Hall: "She talks to Jim Al Khalili about the rate that things have changed, how the web is still not quite what it should be, and about the new discipline she has helped to found known as Web Science."

Hmm. How about "a script a week" on Little Printer? I think that would work. I should do that. Take a note, Basecamp!

Two older men outside talking about being in hospital in the old days. Notably, they're not in hospital now, so whatever they did must have worked.

What language are they speaking? It's not Hebrew. It's not Turkish. It might be Farsi? I think it's Farsi. It could be Farsi.

I thought I would regret that sandwich.
