On the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)

Good morning everyone.

I like the lead font. Or lede, as you would say.

No interruptions please. I'm currently racing on 10ml of Night Nurse and this could go anywhere.

Bob Carolgees' tips on candles. "Alright smarty-pants, why does my wick disappear down inside my candle and put itself out?"

"... a node server and module which clients can use to query data from web documents." I had to do a "sudo npm -g install" before it would take. I think I might need to update the expat module, or something.

Yesterday's issue - 434 - was a tryout of the default Mailchimp template, which claims to be mobile-friendly. There have been no voluble complaints, which means that those sorely aggrieved can't be bothered to get in touch, imagining quite correctly that my skill with the pixels is unlikely to reward further prodding.

One great benefit of not having my own domain any more is that I don't have to worry about having my own domain. Any more. Also, my new host only serves static files, so no more PHP fretting.

Have a lovely day.
