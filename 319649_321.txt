People voice on screen and in real life is often quite different. Two examples, for me, have been Dave Winer and Cory Doctorow. Off-screen, both of them sounded far more relaxed and approachable than I've ever found them online.

I listened to a podcast from Slate called 'Stranger Than Fiction' with Cory Doctorow. I'm certain I've heard Cory talk about e-books before, but I think I missed something. He said that he makes his work available for free - well, under a Creative Commons licence - then, something about encouraging people to buy his print books? Can anyone point me to an explanation of the process? I'm certain I heard the phrase "do the right thing", but that really doesn't sound correct.

I've been thinking about the difference between how-things-are and how-we-describe-things. People often say things about the world as though they were simply true, rather than just how that person sees matters.

I've discovered a way to stop my Mac laptop fans running quite so often: turn off the keyboard backlight. Lovely.

"My favorite reason to have a static site is the sheer amount of resources you can cut out of your stack. I am running multiple sites ... on a VPS with 128 MB of RAM, with no caching yet ... And it's only costing me $10 a year ... So if you're using a beefy VPS from Linode or similar, you might be killing a fly with a sledgehammer."

"This exceptional house in Bessacarr, a popular area close to the large town of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, was designed by the renowned architect Peter Aldington. Built for a close friend of Aldington in 1967, the four-bedroom property was given a rare Grade II listing by English Heritage in recognition of its outstanding design."

Rohin Dhar on the bizarre and complex economics of taxi permits in America. I'm still not entirely sure what a "town car" is.

A south London correspondent contributes this. It's too late for me, though. Old dog, new tricks.
