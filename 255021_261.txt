"[Emil] Post's early death at the age of 57 was almost certainly a direct consequence of the treatment he received for his mental illness. At that time such manic-depressive illnesses were treated with electric shock treatment. It was an horrific treatment for an horrific illness and one which caused great distress. It was based on nothing better than the fact that after patients received this treatment many had periods of more normal mental states. Post received the electric shock treatment on a number of occasions and it was while he was in a mental institution, shortly after receiving electric shocks, that he suffered a heart attack and died."

"[Building] front ends for real languages is extremely hard because of the amount of detail that has to be just right; C++ because of its sheer complexity is a kind of holy grail in the front-end building space. A good program transformation system has a means for acquiring robust front-ends, and ideally, a set of such front ends exist to allow immediate application of the program transformation tool to real software engineering tasks."

Some of us actually like modernist architecture.

Hire bikes in New York seem as clunky as those in London. I think the idea is: make the bikes unattractive to thieves - by making them heavy? You end up with a bike people won't steal, but that others won't ride. From the comments: "For someone who claims to ride a bike regularly, you come off in your article as either clueless or snobbish."

Thinking about "the inevitability of poverty". What's the title of John Bird's book?

"JOSS was dubbed 'The Helpful Assistant' and is renowned for its conversational user interface. Originally green/black typewriter ribbons were used in its terminals with green being used for user input and black for the computer's response. Any command that was not understood elicited the response 'Eh?'."

Oh, for goodness sake, stopping running about and bumping into each other!

Brave New World:"The Park Lane Hospital for the Dying was a sixty-story tower of primrose tiles. As the Savage stepped out of his taxicopter a convoy of gaily-coloured aerial hearses rose whirring from the roof and darted away across the Park, westwards, bound for the Slough Crematorium."

Have a good day.
