... I thought oEmbed was a great idea: but that 'providers' list is pretty short. Have people given up?

Siracusa was right about Minecraft mods. Awful.

I'm just going to do it in PHP. How bad can it be. Okay, that's starting to sound insane. Sinatra, then. That would be less awful. Or node? I need to sit down.

Dave Winer describes an editor and server combination that passes chunks of JavaScript around. I like that sound of that. At first I wondered if Opa might be useful, but I'm pretty sure that lower-level work would be required - and preferable - in node. Dave has ported quite a lot of Frontier's "verbs" to plain old JS - an npm installable module can't be far off. Opa is great, but I always have the feeling that I might as well just settle down to node ...

Is there any way of persuading Safari under iOS 7 not to reload every single thing I look at?

I'm pretty sure I've pointed to this before: hosted Lua scripts, pretty much. Very nice!

I need a break. From things. Seriously.

A Little Printer publication needs to fit into a maximum of 800px long by 384px wide - and a suggested 10px padding at the top with a rule at the bottom. They deal with the gutters. Okay then. I should set up a template.

The Dropbox 'Saver' widget is a nice way to let users download straight to Dropbox without all the auth hassle. Simple, not exactly 'integration', but pretty good for many tasks.

Today: "... Dr Caroline Shenton will deliver the first Open Lecture of the 2013/14 series, discussing the great fire of 1834 which destroyed much of the old Houses of Parliament in a now largely-forgotten disaster."

I'm exhausted. It's all my fault.

Onwards.
