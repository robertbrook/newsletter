Good morning. I'll be in a better mood tomorrow, I expect.

I'm not a heavy calendar user - well, I do use the Apple Calendar application, but I don't live in it. A couple of people I like seem to like BusyCal, the latest beta of which supports Exchange. Personally I want a much more simple UI, but you might like this.

------------------------------------------------------------

I've more and more tried to be flat and neutral to the world. I someone approaches me and asks me for something - if I can give the it and have no reason not to, I just give it. That should keep my interactions down to an acceptable minimum, with the least surface area for potential upset. I annoy a lot of people a lot of the time.

But! How do you give people bad news? I don't know how to do that. If I was a plumber, I could say "You've got a leak there mate." If I was a doctor I could say "I don't think you should go skiing with your knee in that condition." Those things are straightforward and relatively self-evident.

But some of the things people ask me about aren't quite like that. They're not exactly matters of opinion, but they're certainly areas where opinions might be held.

Here's some things I've not said over the past fortnight:

"Yes, that's a great idea. Amazon runs a business on the basis of it. Were you thinking of competing with them?" - No reason why not, of course. Just because I have no ambition doesn't mean other people should give up their dreams.

"If it's so simple, why do you think the three previous people you asked to do it walked away?" - bad luck, possibly? Three oddly similarly incompetent people in a row?

"You've spent months designing your service - and you want my advice the week before you go live?" - you don't really want to hear anything other than "Well done!", I expect.

"You're starting a business in a field strewn with massive competitors. You can't plug one bit of your website into another - and if I can't do it for you that's going to be my fault?"

"What gives you the impression anyone actually wants to buy this?"

And so on. I'm such a grumpy old man. Do these people really want advice? Surely not. I should just keep quiet and let them do what they want.

I wish I could make them happy.
