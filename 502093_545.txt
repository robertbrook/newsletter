I wrote this.

My bus, my own personal bus, pulled up behind a van recently with the inscription "No Tools Left In This Van Overnight" - edited possibly by the van driver to read "No Fools Left In This Van Overnight". I was slightly impressed by that. But then I thought "who says 'fools' any more?". I'm still thinking about it.

Remember FOUC? That still happens, with web fonts, a lot. Some pages I look at spend seconds loading snazzy web fonts. Is it worth the wait?

People already arguing in the 'Quiet Carriage', about - the noise made by someone turning off a mobile phone. My goodness! This makes my mild bouts of pique look almost normal. Actually I had no idea we were in the 'Quiet Carriage', so I may have been unwittingly transgressing all this time. You know, blinking too loudly, double-clicking on the iPad screen, that sort of thing. Awful.

I'm trying to use the MetaCPAN API to list recent module releases by size. I'm not doing that well, so far. I'm falling back on this rather clumsy query. I'm sure I should give it another go.

And another thing, about the writing. Thankfully no-one is really interested enough to recommend writing tools to me, despite my apparent inability to bother proof-reading my own work. If anyone did, though, I'm ready for them. Thanks, but no thanks. I don't want some blasted app telling me my sentences are too long, or short, or that I repeat myself, or that I should find an alternate word for whatever, or whatever. I'll write what I like, you nannying algo!

"... an Uzbek pasta dish made with fresh hand-rolled noodles and horse meat." I'm pretty sure I've never had hand-rolled noodles.

I'm still not sleeping well. I used to put it down to being too hot, or cold, or something. Now I put it down to age and angst.

I think apps - or as I like to call them, "apps" - might well spoil everything. For everybody. For ever.

Enjoy today. Really. Enjoy it. I mean, you never know, do you. Anything might happen. Those stairs look slippery. It would be terrible if you slipped on those stairs. By accident.
