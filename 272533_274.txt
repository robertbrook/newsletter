My feelings on iCloud are following those of Merlin Mann, though I'm a few months behind him. It feels fine for light use, but seems to fracture pretty quickly under load. I'm losing faith in it. I hope it gets seriously beefed up soon - or I'll just have to say goodbye to it.

Thanks to Gary of Hackney Tools for the reminder about Shapeways. I still know a few people who smoke, so I recommend this great product: a combination espresso and single cigarette cup.

There's nothing left to say to people who smoke, is there. Though I never really felt the urge to say anything anyway. What business is it of mine if someone smokes? I'd have an answer if a smoker asked something like "Do you mind if I smoke here?" - but I don't feel the need to offer my opinion. Presumably smokers smoke with the knowledge of what it entails. Just as I indulge in things knowing the consequences.

I wanted to write about method and process - this is as far as I've got, so far.

I can't remember who it was, but someone described money as a "proxy for attention". That seems to make sense. And if you turn that around - attention might be a proxy for money.

I've never backed anything on Kickstarter. This is different. Shoreditch Works is aiming to open a disused warehouse as a 'village hall'. " We're going to build an events space that will comfortably hold 200 people seated. And we are giving 20% of slots for free to community groups that are important but don't necessarily have the cash to hire a big events space. A space where kids can come and code after school, where artists can present their work, where local meetups can take place and where our coworkers can meet and discuss their issues." That sounds like something I can put my money into. Thanks to Liz Conlan for pointing this project out to me. At the time of writing, they're just over half-way to a goal of Â£50,000 - with a close date of 8th June ...
