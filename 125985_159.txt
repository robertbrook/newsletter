And speaking of dead dodos: "The plane is in no way solid, so if the player somehow manages to reach it's set height, they will just phase right through it. This remains the same in the missions. It is only solid to weapons. Despite it being unobtainable, it can be set on fire."

Right: I'm switching out all my boring corporate and robot RSS feeds for those generated by humans. Hit list so far includes, in no particular order: Ben Terrett, Chris Heathcote, Tom Taylor, Giuseppe Sollazzo, Anne McCrossan, Adriana Lukas, Simon Gough, Mario Menti, Tom Morris, ... if you know who I am and you have a blog, or anything that produces an RSS feed that isn't a robot, would you mind letting me know? I added Merlin's tumblr too. Perhaps I shouldn't. I'm going to eat some raisins and parse things. And worry. Mainly worry.

I'm sure I posted this ages ago, but here it is again. "PhantomJS is a headless WebKit with JavaScript API. It has fast and native support for various web standards: DOM handling, CSS selector, JSON, Canvas, and SVG."

Oh and then wiped my site again. For the twentieth time. I can't do it any more. I just can't. Some of us don't have either an ability or willingness to share something with the world. Maybe i did once, but my goodness I don't now.
