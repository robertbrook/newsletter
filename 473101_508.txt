Lazar Berman, quoted by Martin Anderson: "Now obviously there should be a high standard of performance but, after all, one can't be so technical in a live performance. There are mistakes then whether you like it or not. That's why I concentrate so much on the emotional aspect when making a record. ... I am not interested in performing once or twice with hardly any mistakes if it means a lessening of emotional commitment."

"Cheburashka is male, has a bear-like body, large round ears, and is about the size of a 5-year-old child. After being turned down by the zoo as an 'animal unknown to science,' Cheburashka gets hired as a window display for a discount store selling factory seconds because he resembles one. He lives in a phone booth."

Have fun.
