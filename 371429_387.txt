Stephen Murray: 'The rise, fall and transformation of Bankside power station, 1890-2010'. "Bankside was too new for official listing as a building of architectural or historical importance despite the precedent set in 1980 when Battersea power station was listed. In 1988 the Department of the Environment adopted the 30-year rule for newer buildings, but Bankside was not included because following privatisation of the electricity industry the site 'had been given to Nuclear Electric as an asset to exploit'."

Linda Grant on 'the Bethnal Green Bambinos', quoted by George Szirtes and originally published in the Jewish Quarterly: "The insertion of these very obvious Jews in this most British of films was not the only clue about its origins. ‘Passport to Pimlico’ is a comic investigation of Englishness. Not Britishness, which is rarely mentioned. Britain is an institutional entity, it’s government, Home and Foreign Office; it runs the Empire. Englishness is what the characters feel themselves to be inside." ... "‘Passport to Pimlico’ is a portrait of an England idealised by immigrants."

After Giles' note on folk moving away from Flickr, I'v been digging. Here's Dave Townsend:
"Flickr was the first big site in the game and has a great API. They are the Facebook of photo hosting. Almost any application or tool that does anything with photos boasts some level of integration with Flickr, support for other sites is random at best." And Jacob Penderworth: "A big turnoff for people who want to use Flickr is the need of a Yahoo account in order to properly use the service. You can browse the Web site all you want, but if you actually want to contribute, you must sign up. ... In the end, the truth is that 500px developers actually care about their creation and Yahoo has not shown that it does." ...

... Scott Bourne also notes possibly upload throttling on Flickr's new 1Tb Pro account.

I never worried about using Yahoo to sign in to Flickr, but then I already had a Yahoo account. Now I won't bother with things that require a Facebook account. Really I should just stop worrying about all this stuff and put photos on a domain I control.
