"The Raisin Administrative Committee is a federal marketing order, led by 47 growers, packers and a public member. The RAC is directly overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture and was created in 1949 as a result of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937." ...

"Truth is nothing without the power to wield it." I've been accused of many things, especially over the last year or so. I don't really believe in truth, or indeed in power. Things are more complicated that that.

Have a good day.
