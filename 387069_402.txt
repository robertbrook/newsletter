I should do something special. I think the something special might just occur. I just have to carry on doing. Rubbing the sticks together. No guarantees, of course.

Perversely, reminding people that they can unsubscribe has garnered a few more subscribers. What's wrong with you people? Of course now you'll all click that unsubscribe link. Maybe. You don't have to.
