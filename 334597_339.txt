Good morning.

My weight is drifting down towards 60kg again. Not a good sign.

Thanks to @marxculture for telling me about this group: "The aim of this group is to link people involved in or interested in getting involved in making educational games and apps." And they have several hundred members! They have an event coming up at the end of August, which I should put in the calendar.

Thanks again to everyone who sends in links and suggestions - I do live in a bit of a bubble and anything outside it is often a genuine surprise. Thank you for taking the time to let me know about things that might seem obvious to you, but I've almost certainly not heard of.

Officers of the Rechabite Temperance Society included the High Chief Ruler President, Sick Steward Sick Visitor and Tent Steward Assistant at Meetings. "It was a total abstinence movement for the whole family. Other organisations with a branch structure simply propagated the temperance message in an atmosphere of mutual support. ... The movement spread the message of total abstinence and the word of the gospel." ...

... The orders in the society were the "Knight of Temperance, Knight of Fortitude, and Covenanted Knight of Justice." ...

A south London correspondent directs me to this method of calculating the lifting capacity of helium balloons. You know, just in case.

I didn't know there was a planned 'deep level' District Line - though I passed through South Ken many times on the way to and from school ...

... also, a similar 'express' version of the Northern was planned. I wish I could make a 'remixed' tube map, with all these odd additions on it. Come to think of it, I could just draw it.
