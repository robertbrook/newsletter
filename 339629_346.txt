Good morning.

I do miss posting photos - and Apple's Photostream is pretty weak. Maybe iOS 7 and Mavericks will help that a bit. Maybe I should just post photos to my own site! What an amazing idea.

I put back the "http" or "https" in the text links. Some client's weren't picking them up properly.

Lloyd Davis pointed me to this, on my nervousness about contacting people who's work I follow. "God this person is so cool." ... "But they'd probably think I was weird if I said that." ... "God I wish people would comment on my stuff."

Jane Mason advises: "Don't buy bread that comes sliced a plastic bag"; "Don't eat breakfast cereal unless it is porridge that you cook yourself"; "Use your lovely bread ... to make your own sandwiches"; "Don't buy anything at a coffee shop other than coffee"; "Don't buy anything from a supermarket that someone else has cooked already"; "eat something different every day"; "Dramatically cut down on sugar". I wonder how I'd feel if I swapped sugar for fat. Or protein, I suppose. Does fruit count as sugar? Surely not.

A history of the 'MV Ross Revenge', later home to Radio Caroline. "All went well until August 19, 1989 when Dutch authorities raided the Ross and took most of her broadcast equipment to Holland, the ship stayed at sea and once again in a good Caroline tradition she started broadcasting again, but on lower power. There was however no income for the station anymore and sadly her final broadcast as a true Marine broadcaster was heard on November 6 1990. The ship stayed at sea but in November 1991 she started drifting and ended up on the Goodwin Sands sandbank off the Kent coast."

Stephen Holden reviews 'Russian Dolls', 2005 - "[CÃ©dric] Klapisch's style might be described as Truffaut Lite. He treats digital video with some of the same devil-may-care playfulness that Truffaut brought to film. Sequences are sped up, one scene is broken into digital patches, the timeline is scrambled, and fantasies embellish reality."
