561 - A CRACK IN THE ICE - on the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)
Good morning.

What a sad thing to be arguing about.

R.G. Keen, 1999: "If you're into building your own electronics, having a vast array of prototyping skills and tricks is incredibly useful. The urge to build something doesn't always happen when it's convenient or when you have just the right materials. Here's a collection of useful methods and tricks for building circuit boards."

... ah yes, here he is: "Head of Service Development at EE". Interesting that he puts his open source code on Github in his LinkedIn profile.

Some people are just different. Maybe it's a 'Two Cultures' thing. They're never going to like it, or get it, or do it. They think they're right and you're wrong and that's it.

"The VCS3 was quite popular among progressive rock bands and was used on recordings by The Alan Parsons Project, Jean Michel Jarre, Hawkwind, Brian Eno (with Roxy Music), King Crimson, The Who, Gong, and Pink Floyd, among many others." I've been enjoying the iPad version.

Talks at Cambridge University. Wonderful, but RSS feeds only for individual talks? Am I missing something obvious? Wait a minute, there's a list which includes all the talks ...

... yesterday, unfortunately: "This talk is a basic introduction to the wonderful world of Higgs bundles on a Riemann Surface, and their moduli space. The talk will survey the basics of the theory focusing on the rich geometry of the moduli space of Higgs bundles."

I will eat some pizza. Marinara is the only true pizza. #biteme

I still think 'face computers' is funny.

Enjoy today.
