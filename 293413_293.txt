"When you control a man's thinking you do not have to worry about his actions. You do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder. He will find his 'proper place' and will stay in it. You do not need to send him to the back door. He will go without being told. In fact, if there is no back door, he will cut one for his special benefit. His education makes it necessary."

Added to a list of things I don't want to talk about: how much things cost. "As someone who grew up in cities in the south and now lives in London, I'd rather saw my own leg off than live in rural Yorkshire. There just isn't anything there that appeals to me. Newcastle would be less scary - I'd only give up a foot to avoid living there."

Thanks to Liz Conlan for this one - I'm getting a taste for the order stuff that Has Bean can turn out. Lovely.

I was listening to "The Unpleasantness At The Bellona Club" or the wireless: it's actually quite a grim story, weirdly book-ended with chirpy 1920s piano music. Quite odd.
