Daniel Pick reviews 'Correspondence 1904-1938: Sigmund Freud and Anna Freud' - "He could be soothing and at times exceptionally blunt, telling the youngster on one occasion she was 'a bit odd', and suggesting her backache, incurred while embroidering, was simply the displacement of her ambivalence towards her beautiful sister Sophie; the implication was that she was hysterically using her body because she could not bear to complete stitching her wedding present.

Unidirectional flow means that air moving through bird lungs is largely 'fresh' air and has a higher oxygen content."

Nothing is more tempting than simply nothing.
