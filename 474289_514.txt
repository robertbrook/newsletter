Who was St. Wite? "The hymn-writer, folklorist and hagiographer Sabine Baring-Gould has suggested that she is the fifth-century Breton St Blanche." - or? - "Rather than being a Breton, or German, with companions in high places, the local image of St Wite is that of a holy woman or hermit killed during a ninth century Danish raid."

Joey Aghion: "If your app employs a common architecture, you can probably use the OpsWorks dashboard to define layers, add a few instances, link your git repo and be up and running." ...

Just before 1900, most likely.

I'm not culling some links because the writing is just too bad. Only a few, but I'm far less forgiving.

After all the patent nonsense, I'm feeling far less like clicking that icon ...

http://marked2app.com
... this, however, is always worth a click. "... intelligent writing features, flexible options and a wide range of support for various markup formats, editing tools and publishing platforms ..."

John Graham-Cumming: "A long time ago I banished most electronics from my bedroom as a way of getting a good night's sleep. ... The phone is sent away to another room for the night to recharge in silent mode. There's no computer so that I don't work in the same place I sleep and therefore delay going to bed."

I really would like to write more - and I will, but my goodness I'm tired right now. The days are just packed, to re-coin that phrase. Also, lots of mail to catch up with. Lots and lots. Let's do that!
