"Classical music often seems rather serious, and something to be 'understood' in a scholarly way. I'm certainly not saying that's right, but it's often the impression people get. Gould's humming does away with that, because it forces you to see the music as something to love and to be transported by."

Ruby debugging with single-letter methods. There's already 'p' an 'y' in Ruby - of course we should have expressive names, but in the old days we did all sort of crap with code. Pre-agile.

I think the reason people think I'm 'tech'-ish is because I seem to concern myself with that sort of thing, apparently to the exclusion of other things. It's certainly not because I 'do' tech.

This is where faith in markets gets you, I suppose. Of course, markets don't require faith - there are just markets. Or not. Markets exist wherever people can be persuaded there's something of value to buy. No, I'm not an economist.

Via John Keogh: "The entire history of jazz could sometimes be heard in [Lol] Coxhill's playing, from Dixieland through swing and bebop to the soundbending experiments of the most avant-garde, but a melodic aspect to his performances could charm people who thought themselves allergic to jazz saxophone."
