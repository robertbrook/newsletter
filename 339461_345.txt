"The C debugger, cdb, is marginally useful for digging through the dead bodies of C programs. db, the assembly language debugger, is actually more useful most of the time, but you have to know more about the machine and system to use it well.

... that 'visual debugger'.

I'm pretty much giving up on 'news'. As someone I'm overly fond of quoting says - if it's important, it'll reach me. In fact, if it's interesting, it already reaches me most of the time.

"In nuclear physics, the boundaries for nuclear particle-stability are conceptualized as drip lines. The nuclear landscape is understood by plotting boxes, each of which represents a unique nuclear species, on a graph with the number of neutrons increasing on the abscissa and number of protons increasing along the ordinate ..." #spoons
