547 - A LAMP IN THE TREES - on the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)

Hello.

I have another rather niche Little Printer publication nearly ready. It's not of interest to many people, I imagine. I'll manage to get it running soon, I hope.

I'm glad 'Ripper Street' is getting picked up by someone. Matthew Macfadyen is a great actor. In fact, I think he should be the next Dr. Who, as if I cared who was the next Dr. Who. I mean after Capaldi. Macfadyen should do Dark Who. No jokes or winks to the camera. Punching Cybermen, that sort of thing. The gritty reality of Gallifrey.

I am watching a purple rubbish container bob down the Thames under Battersea Bridge. Whistler is watching, too.

Tanja Deuss: a great photo print of the London Eye, for â‚¬35.

Python 3 and Perl 6 aren't exactly taking the world by storm. An interesting dynamic, I think: both of these are mature languages, with very extensive libraries available. However, both of these upgrades are - to some extent - challenges to their own history. People new to code will see the long, complex backstory. People who run Python and Perl today will only see the challenge.

jumpstarter.io may be interesting, but I find some of the web UI confusing. What does that icon mean? What will happen if I leave this box unchecked?

I'm slowly getting used to using Editorial on the iPad. It really is very good. I'm especially looking forward to the next version, which apparently has a configurable on-screen word count.

And now, a sandwich.

Is there any way of opening an "Office Open XML word processing document" on an iPad? I'm asking for a friend. I ended up forcing it open in PDFpenPro on the desktop, of all things. Well, at least it worked.

I over-ran a little yesterday, so today's a touch lighter. Have a perfectly normal day.
