"In 2010, JPMorgan quietly embarked on a huge buying spree in the copper market. Within weeks — by the time it had been identified as the mystery buyer — the bank had amassed $1.5 billion in copper, more than half of the available amount held in all of the warehouses on the exchange. Copper prices spiked in response. At the same time, JPMorgan, which also controls metal warehouses, began seeking approval of a plan that would ultimately allow it, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, a large money management firm, to buy 80 percent of the copper available on the market on behalf of investors and hold it in warehouses. The firms have told regulators that these stockpiles, which would be used to back new copper exchange-traded funds, would not affect copper prices. But manufacturers and copper wholesalers warned that the arrangement would squeeze the market and send prices soaring."

I seem to have edged slowly into iOS 7 and Mavericks with no ill effect, as far as I can make out. We'll see. I have to say I'm slightly underwhelmed by Mavericks. Perhaps Apple has had enough of the desktop for a while. There wasn't much of the iOS-style redesign at all.

In fact, Apple paid more attention to iCloud. I should write about that. In fact, I will this week. I have another thing I can roll it into.

"Today, we can get away with ‘knowing’ how Google works without understanding what a ‘principal eigenvector’ is. Tomorrow, we need to absolutely know that." - again and again, I keep coming back to mathematics.

The fire seems very low, as if it were always wishing not to be left alight.

Onwards.
