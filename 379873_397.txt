Hi there.

https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks
Jens MÃ¶nig and Brian Harvey not only built the wonderful Snap website, they even released the code: "a visual, blocks based programming language inspired by Scratch". It works, straight out of the box. Amazing stuff.

http://blog.everpix.com
Thanks to Ilicco Elia for letting me know about Everpix: the blog seems to give a little more information than the front page itself. No, I don't want to watch a video to find out about your product. Your photos: "everything in one place, automatically organized, and ready to be rediscovered."

I had a horrible code setup configuration time. And now it's gone. And I'm not thinking about that any more. It works and that's all I care about. This is why I can't be a developer.

So tired. My knees hurt.

Look - I know a mail from me every day isn't to everyone's taste. I also know that quite a few people don't actually get round to reading this. I'm speaking to the absent choir here, I expect! The thing is, you really can unsubscribe. Yes, I will get an email saying you have, but you shouldn't worry about that at all.

I understand. Really, I do. Just scroll down to the bottom of the page and click that 'unsubscribe' link. If you felt like it, you could always come back later. You know where I am.

And there are a good couple of hundred more of these things to go, you know. The newsletter will carry on until my next birthday, which is early in May next year. You've quite a lot to put up with until then. But then, no more daily newsletter - and no more Fading City. I'm going to do other things.

Well, the same sort of content, broadly, but not so often and in a different format. You might like it. Come back then.

Or, alternatively, you might think someone else wants this sort of ... 'material', you could point them to the URL above.

I do want to do a podcast again as well. I enjoyed it. That's not to say that anyone listening shared my view - but, hey, people subscribed, so there's that.

Okay, so their website looks a bit dated, but Textexpander is an extraordinary utility. Hard to explain just how useful it is. There's a companion iOS app too.
