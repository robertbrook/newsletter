HASYMO's 'City of Light', a remix, over the original video.

Left my headphones behind. Disaster.

"Letâ€™s make a concurrent web scraper! We will use Haskell, because it allows easy concurrency."

I really have churned out some dreadful code recently. It starts out not working, the slowly improves until it does work. Success!

I have a friend from Bermuda who has the same first name as me: his nickname is "Red", though I've not heard him called that for many years. Here's a selection of fantastic nicknames, including "Socky", "Jumbo", "Fast Eddie", "Punchy" and "The Cat with the Yellow Shades". Unsurprisingly, some of these aren't exactly complimentary. Some you may find derogatory.

A few days ago I met two people deliberately at White City station - and another three there in the same ten minutes by chance: one from work, one from the BBC and one who had lived opposite the station for years without me ever knowing. It was lovely to see you all!

A lot of interest in the flexbox spec - implementations don't seem to have calmed down yet. "In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can "flex" their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent."

The rain and cold have stopped in London, mostly. So we're starting to dig up the roads again.

Thanks to Liz Conlan for telling me what BEM probably stands for: "BEM stands for Block-Element-Modifier."

Someone just mistook me for the postman.

"... a simple, easy-to-use online data import service that helps you transfer business or personal data between cloud apps." - Salesforce, Tumblr and two I've not heard of.

I do miss Spotify, a little. But my musical taste is so restricted that old YouTube videos usually do the trick.

A correspondent tells me that there's more than one way to boil and egg - at least, I think so. From the reviews: "The spaghetti bolognaise is one recipe that I remember with much fondness." ... "When my ex-wife announced an unexpected divorce in 1990, I had to learn very quickly, how to cook; in order to survive."

A rather under-rated film, I think: Dredd, 2012. From the reviews: "For sci-fi action fans, it's an instant classic. For everyone else, it's a dark, bloody mess."

"How do I go create Backbone collections out of an ajax call to a server that provides data in XML?"
