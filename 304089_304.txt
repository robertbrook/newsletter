I thought, I can't work out what people want. So, why not just wait until someone asks for something, then if I can give them it, do that? Well, it's gone pretty quiet. But not entirely silent.

CouchDB, node.js and JS all the way down. Hoodie looks like an interesting experiment.

"The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) is a large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) ..." - beautiful and easy to use.

Looks like a web-based Dash docs browser. Someone needs to re-invent man pages. Or info files. DevDocs is a great, fast reference for HTML + CSS.

A "Scroll-based EPUB Reader for Mac" - I'm sure I remember a PDF reader like this. Under a tenner on the App Store.

"Having children lowers your happiness levels, but your happiness increases when they grow up and leave home." Cripes! I suppose this is simply data, but it's a grim read, isn't it? I don't feel I'd be happier without being a parent, but then that's just me, of course.
