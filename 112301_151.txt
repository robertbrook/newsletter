"He made it past the letter K. But at some point during L — the one about the masturbation contest to the death — the poor guy ran out of the movie screening, threw up and left. Who knows what X would have done to him." L? L? Oh, right. Libido. "Mr. Timpson said much of the film was inspired by children’s books, especially alphabet primers, which 'all have a black humor subtext, especially the British ones.'" Well there's a surprise.

"The Sengerphone was actually made of papier mâche which removed the metallic rasp of a megaphone, preserving the tonal qualities of the voice aided by the fact that the orifice did not just cover the mouth but also the nostrils so the resonance of the nasal cavities was retained. The Sengerphone Company was successful and the instrument was used by the Admiralty in both wars."

Gibbon, 1762: "That respectable body, of which I have the honour of being a member, affords a sight truly English; twenty, or perhaps thirty, of the first men in the kingdom in point of fashion and fortune, supping at little tables covered with a napkin in the middle of a coffee room, upon a bit of cold meat on a sandwich, and drinking a glass of punch."

The first appearance of coffee in London came with recommendations for it's use: "'to be drunk, fasting half an hour before, and not eating an hour after, and to be taken as hot as possibly can be endured; the which will never take the skin off the mouth, or raise any blisters by reason of that heat." - not quite the first coffee, but at least the first coffee-house.

Prince Puckler-Muskau: "... the foreigner must admire the refinement of comfort which the Englishman brings to the art of sitting; I must confess that anyone who does not fully understand that work of genius, the English chair, designed for every grade of fatigue, illness and peculiarity of constitution, has truly missed a great part of earthly life."

"... Auden came back from tea with Tom [T. S. Eliot], and having asked why he played so many games of patience, was distressed at the momentary depression in Tom's reply, 'Because it's the nearest thing to being dead.'" That's patience. The card game.
