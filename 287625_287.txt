Tweetbot on the Mac is Â£13.99? Someone's making money.

The thing I liked about Windows Phone, or Metro, or whatever it's called, is being picked up in the design on iOS 7. So I'm happy about that. I like it. Cleaner, clearer, yes please.

Thanks to Jeremy Gould for reminding me of something I really should have known: Daring Fireball membership includes "separate full-content RSS feeds for articles and the Linked List".

Restoration of English Electric Lightning XS422. It's a jet aircraft.

Despite being English, I fret about the weather much less that anyone might reasonably expect. But still, the weather.

'Victorian Secrets and Edwardian Enigmas', from the University of Minnesota, including a series of supposed floor-plans for the rooms in 221b Baker Street. Which, you know, don't actually exist.
