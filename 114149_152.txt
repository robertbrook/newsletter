"It’s a tragic and at times brutal story with lashings of pain and misery throughout. The Sound of Music it is not."

"[Zero Dark Thirty] is supremely pro-US, demonstrated by its exceptionalist, city-upon-a-hill mentality. Even though this comes across with the same irksome jingoism that makes Homeland a touch corny, Bigelow infers that the capturing of Osama bin Laden was deeply symbolic; it wouldn’t end terrorism but repaid the 9/11 blood debt and reaffirmed America’s martial greatness in the eyes of the world."

"The Duke of Wellington was once famously turned away from the doors because he was guilty of the double solecism of arriving 7 minutes late and wearing trousers rather than knee-breeches."

I don't think Wellington was missing much, though: "The refreshments on offer were meagre; supper consisted of bread and butter and fairly plain cake, with tea and lemonade to drink."

Ruggata tal-Lewz, described in a Maltese drink - "Place the water, sugar, lemon rind, cloves and cinnamon in a pot and let it boil" ...

... speaking still of Maltese food, Ful Imgiddem sounds lovely.

In Dungannon, in Tyrone - a plaque put up to Margaret Noble, later Sister Nivedita, described by Rabindranath Tagore as "a mother of the people".

I walked with my son from our side of the river to the Kings Road, through the back streets and down by an even more circuitous route. We passed by Cheyne Walk and spoke on Henry the king, Sir Hans and his valet the Don Saltero: "His reputation as a mixer of punch was very high; he could also shave, bleed, draw teeth, and play a little on the fiddle, and every year he added stranger oddities to his queer mimic museum, from which he probably got as much amusement as his many visitors." ...

... here, wonderfully, is a copy of the 'catalogue of rarities', Don Saltero's coffee-house; including "a curious pebble from Scarborough ... a curious sword set with polished steel, presented by the king of Lilliput to capt. Gulliver ... the leg of a Guiney deer ... skeletons of mice ... an elf's arrow ... a piece of rotten wood, not to be consumed by fire ... petrified rain ... a parrot's egg laid at Chelsea ... a very small starved frog ... the triangle fish ... the Bible in shorthand ... a surprising large moth from Constantinople ... a stone in the shape of a toad ... a pair of gauntlets ... a chicken with four legs". You don't get that in Starbucks.
