If I've ever made you coffee, it's most likely like this - on a rather battered stove-top thing. Interesting that Coffee Collective don't mention any tamping. My goodness, what do I sound like.

Via @bobcatrock. Paul Hartnoll: “We can get a great big thunderous beat … but melody is the real icing on the cake for me. If I get a really good melody, I get really excited about thinking about what’s going to come. That’s when I burst into tears, thinking, ‘That’s it!’ The hook’s got you, and you know you’re going to finish that piece.”

I've been turning this over and over - anarchism? Can you have progress, or even statis, with individuals rather than groups? Isn't this the theory of The Great Man? That always made me nervous. I'd rather turn towards the world and by crushed by it that turn away and be abandoned by it. "And then something amazing happens. You realize that you manage to work out problems in the company with others, that you achieve goals you believed were beyond your reach. That you're getting more confident about your abilities and your self-worth. That you face tough decisions with courage and honesty. That you actually like waking up in the morning to go to work. That not only your work, but also your whole life has a meaning." This is after they - the company - went bankrupt. I'm really not sure.

I used to like AppleScript. Now it just irritates me. Like Gruber, I's amazed it clings on. Like Gruber, I'm not willing to wade into Objective C. I miss UserTalk and HyperTalk. I hope Apple doesn't divide the user and developer types even more over the next few years.

I'm having problems explaining things to someone. They've asked me to help them do things with computers and the web. I'm trying to tell them that what they want is complicated and will take a lot of experience and possible cost some money. I don't think I've been clear enough. Selfishly, I don't want them to fail to do what they wanted and then blame me. I'd rather they simply failed.
