Good morning.

I'm going to try an experiment. I have a necessary task to complete in front of a screen, then my time is my own for a while before I should sleep. Usually this time I fill with things which require mental application. Writing, reading.

Tonight I shall try to end the day, the time between the day and the night, with no mental activity. I shall try to sit and - well, do nothing, I suppose. An experiment. I'll let you know how it goes.

Readdle's "Calendars 5" is much better than the default iOS calendar app. But it doesn't support invitations in iCloud calendar events, yet. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Apple simply didn't allow that as a function. However, I find Apple's default calendar date picker so difficult to use that Readdle's app is worth paying for as a replacement for this function alone ...

... I also like Readdle's "Shakespeare" app, despite it's rather dated look and feel.

Two beds, two baths. £1.75m. Nice, though. Well, it's very open. Think of the heating bills ...

... I suppose if you're spending £1.29m you wouldn't really worry much about that sort of thing ...

... how about two beds on the sixth floor of the Trellick Tower, for £385,000? Not with my knees. Oh, it's all too much.

Anyway. That experiment. Now I know what timers are for. Fifteen or twenty minutes was quite difficult for me to judge. I'm going to try half an hour later this evening. Just after I've finished this, actually.

It's not that I'm wanting to do absolutely nothing at all: just to remove that late-night peak of mental activity. Late-night for me, at least.

I've been prodding Texpad on iOS and the Mac recently. They have an iOS API as well, which "enables any iOS application to typeset LaTeX documents on the device using the LaTeX typesetter ...". Very nice.

Have fun.
