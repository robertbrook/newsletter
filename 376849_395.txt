It's odd, really, when you happily give up on things you know you'd like. I'm writing about getting older. This is one of those things, I think. Would I like to go to Portland, listen to interesting people and drink coffee? Of course I would. But that's not going to happen. So I should just put it aside. Such a lot, to put aside. Every day.

If you have to describe a position as "Science-Based" I reckon you should just give up.

You know, you should probably do that thing.

"In loving memory of Dave Hum x" - I saw The Huckleberries playing in Oxford, a few years ago. They were selling CDs and had drawn a reasonable crowd. For some reason, knowing that they're no more made me very sad.

The New York Herald Tribune of 18th November, 1964 - a review: "The sunrise is a beautiful sight and so is the rising of the moon. To the lovers of Gilbert and Sullivan - and we are legion, bless us all - there is an even more inspiring sight. It is the emergence out of the orchestra pit of Mr. Isidore Godfrey, who has been the conductor of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company since roughly A.D. 1066. Mr. Godfrey rose into the ascendant phase at City Center last night at approximately 7:36, The carrot thatch we have loved all these years has now burnished to a silver gold alloy but it could have been dark green for all we cared. What really mattered was that he was there . . . and that the Company was in superb condition, the best that it has been in for years."

More tomorrow!
