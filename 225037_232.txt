"Safari is technically a platform on it's own, separate from the App Store. Until the day that Gatekeeper comes to iOS, it will continue to be the most open way for users to access information on Apple's mobile devices." If you're not worried now, you really should be.

Rob Horning reviews 'Robots Futures', by Illah Reza Nourbakhsh: "We believe that, with the robot, we can manufacture agency: we can build the will to be free into all our machines, regardless of what they might be doing to the agency and freedom of the humans tasked to work with them."

An entirely sensible PHP library for MySQL. Interesting licencing model: download for free, buy a personal licence for $10 or a commercial licence for $50.

TagPort monitors hashtags on Twitter and Instagram. I'd like to see where people take this.

'Chrome for Business', where business means Windows. I've used Chrome Frame in ... places. It seemed to work.

"... if it looks and feels like an app, and lives on your home screen, itâ€™s an App." Yup. That's what I hear, too. I don't agree with the contention that native app developers are necessarily more serious about their work, simply due to overcoming the barrier to entry that doesn't exist on the web.
