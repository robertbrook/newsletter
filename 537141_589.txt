John Steel, October 2007: 'What is a Woodin Cardinal?' - "Roughly speaking, an iteration tree on M is a tree of models with root M that is generated by a certain process. This process involves using a system of measures coding an embedding in one model to generate an embedding with domain in some other model, and thus equips the tree with commuting elementary embeddings from the models earlier on a given branch to those later on that branch."

"Trying to squeeze a thirty minute shave into fifteen minutes with an unguarded blade is risky. Itâ€™s a recipe for painting your bathroom like a scene from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. A crap shave is one of the worst things you can do to yourself in the name of vanity. It sets you up for an awful day and makes you look like a hawk tried to land on your face."

"Essentially I want to say to my manager that I don't want to stay on this team if this person will become the team lead, but obviously that's too much of an ultimatum and not very constructive. How can I convey this sentiment without coming across as rude or obstructing?" - oooh dear.

"London to Ploumanac'h, Brittany ... The highlight of the passage was a request from the RNLI out on a fast RIB, to practice leaping on and off yachts. We were approached and boarded three times with the last man throwing himself into the water to be rescued by his mates."

My mail client shows a folder called "All Body Parts".

Excuse me for just a moment, I have a download on the boil. Oh, for goodness sake - the blasted thing'll take an age yet.

I must say I'm tempted to go back to plain text for everything.

Have fun today.
