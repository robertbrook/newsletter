Is there a website that describes how a gentleman might dress smartly, to different budgets? Of course there is. But I can't find it. There's a chap who goes to the coffee place, regular as clockwork, dressed extremely well. Looks great, but looks expensive. Maybe he has a secret.

That said, things that foster innovation; living in a city, getting enough sleep, reading fiction, getting bored and daydreaming, spending time out in the woods, no bright lights, white noise.

Via @marxculture - email for the rather braver than I! Very clever stuff, but beyond my capabilities.
