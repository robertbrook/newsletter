"After her death, her body was thrown over the wall of the church that had provided her with sanctuary. Some of the users [of poisons provided by Tofana] and purveyors were also arrested and executed, while other accomplices were bricked into the dungeons of the Palazzo Pucci."

You can now set up 'custom' webhooks in Github, including specific JSON messages. Lovely.

If you've got further than I have with Catmandu, you'll find this cheatsheet useful.

Longer hours at work equal shorter hours of life, maybe: "If there is such a relationship between working hours and health, then shorter work hours might actually raise a person's total lifetime work by allowing them to live and work for longer."

"... a free, html5 based font editor" ...

... Jane Librizzi writes: "In Ostroumova-Lebedeva's prints we see the city that Dostoesvky described as 'abstract' and 'intentional'. Strong horizontal axis depict the city's location on the flat lowlands near the Gulf of Finland. Yellow is a favored background color, hinting at the importance of the sun in this extremely northern city, as otherwise the artist worked in muted shades."

I'm not actually looking for a job, obviously. I don't think I have particularly transferrable skills. Skills, sure. Just not ones normal people are interested in.
