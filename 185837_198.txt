Perhaps I might do something nice for my 200th edition. 200 seems quite a lot. No, I'm not going to stop.

Yet another app that looks very much like TextExpander. It's purely coincidence, of course.

James Lees-Milne on Bruce Chatwin: "I have seldom met a human being who exudes so much sex appeal with so comparatively little niceness."

Chatwin's wife Elizabeth, at 71: "She is wearing a fresh, blue Indian cotton shirt and chinos, and she is smoking an Indian bidi, a tiny, rolled, taupe-coloured leaf, filled with tobacco flake and tied up with cotton. Bidis come in a colourful soft packet, which makes them look almost fresh and healthy. They aren't, though. They are much worse for the lungs and skin than regular cigarettes. Elizabeth has tremendous trouble lighting hers. The first 10 minutes of our interview are punctuated by the sound of her blue Bic lighter failing her."

"Use the idle time on your computer ... to cure diseases, study global warming, discover pulsars, and do many other types of scientific research." Is there a UK or EU version of this? Is that a terrible thing to ask?

The Keith Haring Foundation. Site needs a reboot, I reckon.

"You can’t write half a HN comment from your laptop and half from your phone. Most wikis have a ‘save’ button and do locking. Its like the ghostly hand of visual sourcesafe has somehow infected the web with sloppy engineering and a terrible user experience. If your wiki lock expires while you’re doing a big edit, you're in a world of hurt."

One of the best things on the web. Simple tips, easy to navigate. Sad that this is now seen as old-fashioned.

"This is how you fight Google for talent." Cool. Fine.Clojure is great, apparently. Okay. But: if I write on a Mac - and Macs don't come with a JVM installed - I'm nervous. No JVM by default this year: no JVM installable next year?

I think I might be preparing what's called in academic circles a "conference poster". But I'm not completely sure.

"Things are hard sometimes — life is hard. But you try your best and you wait, and eventually things come back up again to the air and the light, sometimes against all your intuition that they will."

Enjoy today.
