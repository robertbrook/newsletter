"Programming is not a job, but a strange search for new problems, one part learning to learn, one part problem solving, and one part borderline-obsessively-curious tinkering. A self-taught programmer must necessarily have all three of those parts to survive as a programmer." I am not, really, a programmer.

Thinking about drugs. You know. Just thinking. But then again I was wondering this morning if anyone had made a reggae version of the theme to 'Knight Rider', so you can never really tell.

Via @bobcatrock: "Morrissey's 15 Most Outrageous Quotes". I'm sure he said some happy things. Perhaps privately.

Terrible feeling of loss.

What is this continuing obsession with 'leadership'? It borders on the fascist. My goodness, why not trust and believe in yourself and those around you!

Much as I don't hate Basecamp, yet, I wish it did outlines. With popouts.

Dropbox updated. The new menubar items are nice.

Plugging away with Apple Reminders. It does enough for me. I'm still getting used to the reminder-calendar Red Sea division. Calendar is for stuff that has to happen on a date, right? So what about "stuff I want to do today"? Calendar doesn't feel like the right place for that. Oddly, you can export an iCal file from Reminders. That seems strange. I'd like a way to cycle through reminder lists, too. I'm not sure about some of the stuff described in Sven Fechner's article, though: but how can I separate out projects and contexts? Maybe I shouldn't. A 'tickler' file doesn't feel right in Reminders. Well, that was what Omnifocus was for, I suppose.

Why isn't Apple Maps on the web? My bet is that it'll never be on the open web: it'll be mobile-only. Or, rather, iOS only. You can't even see it on a Mac! And when's the vaunted data update actually going to happen? Even central London is full of errors. Central London is full of errors!

Bearded fellow with severe glasses furiously tapping out replies to emails on his laptop, with just the index of his right hand. Big fellow, in a suit, looks almost like he's conducting an orchestra. Looks like a young, virile Captain Haddock. I'm half-way-through a rice pudding. He's doing so much better than I am.

The bells! Everyone up! Like meerkats on the veldt, if that's the right place for them. The screens flicker and roll - eyes dart about. And off they trot, doing their duty.
