"a simple and efficient implementation of the Scheme programming language"

I've never really understood people using "pond scum" as an insult. Why the scum form a pond, in particular? Is it somehow worse than scum from other sources?

"the work of self-taught artists and architects, fringe physicists and visionary inventors" - if it's anything like the Japanese 'Souzou' exhibition at the Wellcome Trust, I shall enjoy it.

Via John Keogh. Cover art, by Vincent Di Fate, for 'Last Orders' by Brian Aldiss. I recognise that hand - I'll have to dig out a few old paperbacks and see if they're by him too.

I had to come back from Brighton a littler earlier than expected, so missed out on this wonderful opportunity passed on by Russell Garner: "I have, over the last few months, been constructing a realistic walrus costume, which should fit most people of average proportions, and allow for full and easy movement in character. To take on the position as my lodger you must be prepared to wear the walrus suit for approximately two hours each day ..." - Part of me hopes that it might actually be genuine. Another part fears exactly this.

"A mind is fundamentally an anticipator, an expectation-generator. It mines the present for clues, which it refines with the help of the materials it has saved from the past, turning them into anticipations of the future. And then it acts, rationally, on the basis of those hard-won anticipations." Daniel Dennett

A lovely photo of starlings doing that thing starlings do - massing? - that's not it. What the word? Flocking! Yes, flocking. By the West Pier at Brighton.

"When we speak of dialogue with the sovereign, it seems to me that this can be definitely initiated only on the basis of the greatest possible intransigence, for power today is completely alien to any real discussion." Jacques Ellul

Despite reading this, I'm still not exactly sure what they do, more than hosting photos. Am I missing something?
