Another angry bus driver. Skipping.

A list of "Independent Coffee vendors. Not a Star-Nero-Costa-Bucks in sight." - from Ilicco, so you can trust it.

I've retreated from Milk Bar, sadly, gone back to Monmouth. Monmouth is lovely, though. Despite the newer staff trying to explain things all the time.

The official Heroku buildpack for PHP.

The whole world of servers and cloud and all that stuff is quite extraordinary, now. Things are moving very quickly and it's all rather exciting.

Paul Hendrickson on Janis Joplin and James Dean: "... far better to have them in our minds now as smashed idols, as icons of their separate fiery moments."

Wondering when the last steam trains left Victoria.

"This paper examines the role of the Morton Thiokol engineers in the decisions surrounding the launch of the Challenger, particularly with reference to an analysis of this event by Edward Tufte." ... "It is prima facie unethical to hold people morally responsible for what they did not do or could not reasonably be expected to prevent."

I'm not entirely sure what day it is.

"With dawn breaking, the naked Mickey crows like a rooster and slides down the bottle to magically return to his bed. Everything is back to normal, beyond the happy memory of his experience."

Recommending Leila Johnston again. Go back and watch that video.

"Together [Eleonora] Duse’s books reveal her passion for the arts, her interest in the classics, and her impressive grasp of several European languages. Above all they speak of her commitment to researching in almost scholarly depth the roles she played. Indeed, it is thought that Duse’s approach of immersing herself in the parts that she played laid the foundations for what became known as method acting."

I have put up two old maps. One of London, one of the United Kingdom. They are both rather out of date. I like them.

Have fun today.
