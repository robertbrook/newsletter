At least one reader - well, only one reader so far, as far as I'm aware - is still having difficulty working out what's "mine" here, by which I think they mean "written by you, Robert". Okay, here it is again: if it's in quotes, like a quotation, it's a quotation. If it's not in quotes, it's not a quote. And the things with URLs are indeed websites, almost all of which have been created by people other than me. Or, "me", as you would say.

If companies won't let you have data in RSS, why does anyone think they'll let you have it in RDF? Or am I just missing the bit where you pay?

An east London correspondent tells me that "there's a 3d print store on Clerkenwell Road now". There's something like that on the Strand as well - or some literature about it, at least. Is 3D a thing now?

Via Liz Conlan. Very sad to read reviews of the post-refurb Milk Bar: "we were treated so rudely last time, we made it the last time", "standard seems to have really dropped in all areas", "vibe has gone and it looks pretty generic", "staff are a rotten miserable bunch". I've retreated to Monmouth and they're spot on.

I have a great deal of writing to do.

Has Apple entirely retreated from the server market? Looks like it, pretty much. Adam Engst writes on how to replace Web Sharing: "I won’t comment on whether OS X Server is appropriate for your Web serving needs at the high end, other than to note that we gave up on it several years ago ..." - Again, something Apple just doesn't want you to do. I suppose screen sharing lives on because of the remote admin market? It looks a bit ignored, as does whatever 'Back To Your Mac' is called this month.

People like their things. Let them.

Alfred Soto on 'Sophisti-pop', specifically Swing Out Sister's "Breakout", 1987 - "Note how the first twenty seconds—in which a synth bass alludes to 'West End Girls' while another synth plays an ominous theme—summon six years of British pop before the song’s brass section dismisses them with well-timed blasts of optimism."

Have a lovely day. Enjoy the weather, if you can.
