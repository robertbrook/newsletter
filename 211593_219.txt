In a coffee place I've not been to for a while. They seem to have started selling vinyl. You know, records. Unless they're laserdiscs, I suppose.

I did something I rarely do, recently. I sent something back.

In 2010: "I’ve never attended a Mac conference, but I can safely say I’ve never seen as many Mac laptops in one place as I have at a JavaOne conference. ... As a Java developer though, I have no interest in owning an iPhone since there is no Java support on the iPhone. Why would I own/use a device that does not support the technology that I have spent the last 13 years of my career working with when there are other devices that do suport Java?"

There must be a JVM spec somewhere then. That's quite a list of implementations. That won't go away, I assume?

Leap, from Ironic Software, is a sort of file manager via automatic categorisation and sorting. It's less than £20 and - I think - rather undersold. Check out the screenshots. If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this sort of thing ...

... there's also Yep, for document categorisation. More fun than it sounds. Less work that it sounds, anyway. A bargain, I reckon. No,

Lovely writing again, I think. "... smooth rabbet plane; a first model with adjustable mouth; as-found, free of damage, a bit dirty from sitting idle, it will clean to be a fine worker; good length to the iron, it has the unique cap iron that allows the cutting iron to be removed from the mouth rather than twisting it out; all original parts save for the tote, ..."

A frankly grim, stressful day. I am relaxing by writing some code. In Racket.

An entirely different xMod. This Russian FK-39 field gun is £900 off - yours for only £5,100. Oh, plus VAT.

Thanks for the mail and Twitter nudges. They help, really.
