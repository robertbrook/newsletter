"The competitive nature of the shipbuilding industry and marine classification societies has resulted in reduced design safety margins in ship structures. Shipyards use sophisticated finite element models and high tensile steels to reduce steel weight and production costs in order to be competitive."

A description of one person's five years in a monastery. "Now, though, now is where it gets tricky: the zendo becomes your home. You're comfortable with the form of Zen - chanting, eating out of stupid little bowls, wearing crazy clothes, shaving your head every five days." Doesn't sound like it's for me.

'Ten Lessons I Wish I Had Been Taught', from Gian-Carlo Rota. "Richard Feynman was fond of giving the fol- lowing advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems con- stantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps." ... "My late friend Stan Ulam used to remark that his life was sharply divided into two halves. In the first half, he was always the youngest person in the group; in the second half, he was always the oldest. There was no transitional period." No transitional period, indeed.

I'm typing a lot more now. I don't think it's writing, but it's part of it. I'm glad I'm doing it.

The 'Bexley': "Owned by the Greater London Council and used to take sewage sludge from Beckton Sewage Works out to the Black Deep in the Thames Estuary where it was dumped. These ships used to ply the Thames regularly and were known as the 'Bovril Boats'."

Have a lovely day.
