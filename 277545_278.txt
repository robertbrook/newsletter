"Keeping Up with Scientific Literature" - still, apparently, it's RSS.

My goodness, is that the time?

I'm going to move 'The Pig Hill Gazette' away from Tumblr at some stage. I don't feel confident leaving things there. I might start posting images to - some other domain.

John Golding's painting 'CV', 1973. "The rectangular shapes relate to body imagery, I suppose, in that they are elements into which I can project myself; and the spectator, I hope, can identify himself in the same, very total way. The paler, more contemplative areas which appear in all my works I see, in a sense, as blind mirrors."

We visited a shop on Denmark Street which sold keyboards. In the front there's a Polymoog with a sign saying "PLAY ME!", so we did. The nice chap told us about his band - and how they played a mini-Stylophone things. We played the 'Ode To Joy', with some effects.

Thanks to Giles T. for the reminder about this: Christian Neukirchen's blogging script - includes his own 'HTemplate' and math markup functions. Without those two, it might well end up being below a hundred lines.

Strange how lots of people do things which they know to be unimportant - and ... I forgot what I was going to say.

Popclip: an extensible iOS-alike text selection popup for the Mac. Sounds odd, works great. A bit like Services, but visible.

The coffee at the Notes cart at St. Giles isn't as good as Charlie's cart at the end of Strutton Ground. The original and still the best.

I've been shuffling through the archives, now and then.

I've been trying the 'new' Google Maps, with WebGL. It's not really a map any more, it's a guide. Google should call it that. Google Guide. The rendering is slower than before, but browsers will catch up sometime.

More re: Tinderbox Six - "This is a hell of a lot of design and implementation for $0.99. But thatâ€™s increasingly what people expect to pay for software. OK: maybe $19.95 for something really terrific."

The oldest email I've still got access to is only from 2003. I deleted most of it. I still do.
