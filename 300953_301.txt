'Christos G. Tsagas: "Peculiar velocities change the expansion rate of any observer moving relative to the smooth Hubble flow. As a result, observers in a galaxy like our Milky Way can experience accelerated expansion within a globally decelerating universe, even when the drift velocities are small."

Giles talks to Alex about privacy. Alex says: "If any of your personal data is online, you should expect people to be able to match it to your face sooner or later. ... Your only choice will be to not put your personal data on the internet in the first place." For the moment, I agree. But, think of the internet of a decade ahead: will it still be a place where personal data lives? Maybe not.
