At the time of writing, I have given myself nine times 400 words to write in four days. Plus around a thousand and a half, makes ... just over 5000 words by the end of this week. Wait - I must have my days wrong. Five days. Around a thousand words a day. Right. Onwards.

"Challenging the long-standing convention of the lone genius detective, Sjöwall and Wahlöö created in Martin Beck the prototype of the all-too human policeman working with a motley collection of similarly flawed colleagues." The Radio 4 series is great. One of the best things Neil Pearson has appeared in, too. Recommended.

Drew Crawford: . I like the quote from Miguel de Icaza on .Net, JVM and JS hosted stuff: "Designers of managed languages have chosen the path of safety over performance for their designs." This might get to the heart of why I still look at languages outside those VMs - less safe, more performant? And lots more nods to Lua too.

Paul Graham wrote this five years ago. "If we're all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to do it well." ... "The author is a self-important dilettante." Man, this guy.

Unless it wasn't clear, that was a joke. I remember going to see Paul Graham talk somewhere in London a few years ago. Seemed to make a lot of sense. It's interesting going to talks and such which I'm interested in, but I'm not the key demographic for. I'm not an entrepreneur, or a developer or anything like that - but there's always a lot to be interested in. Meetings are a lot like that. Some meetings.

Pauline Weston Thomas writes on fashions in mourning clothes. "Ordinary clothes could be worn in acceptable subdued shades of grey, white or purple, violet, pansy, heliotrope, soft mauves and of course black. Every change was subtle and gradual, beginning firstly with trims of these colours being added to the black dresses."
