Not that I was ever intending to become a 'consultant', but this rather depressing list includes quite a few pointers as to why I'm not the best person for that sort of job: I don't market myself, I'm not good on the phone, I don't like making new friends, I'm certainly not an expert in anything, I've always had a boss, I don't have a mentor. Doomed!

A longer bio of Matthew Talbot: "Three things I cannot escape: the eye of God, the voice of conscience, the stroke of death. In company, guard your tongue. In your family, guard your temper. When alone guard your thoughts." A bit different for simple death and taxes.

Someone who doesn't like MySQL. "For every successful project built on MySQL, you could uncover a history of time wasted mitigating MySQL's inadequacies, masked by a hard-won, but meaningless, sense of accomplishment over the effort spent making MySQL behave."

Hugh Laurie: "I was, in truth, a horrible child. Not much given to things of a bookey nature, I spent a large part of my youth smoking Number Six and cheating in French vocabulary tests. I wore platform boots with a brass skull and crossbones over the ankle, my hair was disgraceful, and I somehow contrived to pull off the gruesome trick of being both fat and thin at the same time."

An interview with Miles Jupp, on his character 'Damien Trench': "Damien is inspired by any number of cookery writers who I love reading. I suppose the point is that you read these people, and they somehow manage to make their lives sound completely idyllic. Perhaps their lives are like that, but I liked the idea of someone who writes in a very calm, measured way and whose work is enjoyed by an aspirational audience, but who in reality is easily flustered, jumpy and impatient."
