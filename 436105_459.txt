Morning folks.

'Selected works on Cookery', from the Library of Congress; "The Housekeepers Valuable Present, or, Lady's Closet Companion: Being a New and Complete Art of Preparing Confects, According to Modern Practice", "Social Life and Vegetarianism", "Art of preserving all kinds of animal and vegetable substances for several years" and more. Lots of extremely interesting and beautifully presented books.

I'll give it until half past.

"Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum is the only museum in the nation devoted exclusively to historic and contemporary design." The American nation, that is. Here they are on Github; hacking digital signage, a 'panel of experts' image processing suite, colour extraction, image comparison - and most of their collection as JSON.

It's things like the above and the work of Micah Walter, Aaron Straup Cope and others that fill me with the feeling that I should rush back to the office and push, push, push.

I'm not the sort of person who'll ever need to know this. "When preparing for technical interviews in the past, I found myself spending hours crawling the internet putting together the best, average, and worst case complexities for search and sorting algorithms so that I wouldn't be stumped when asked about them." I don't go for interviews.

"Nick [Katsanevas] and his brother in-law, John Katzourakis, founded the first Crown Burgers in 1978. He loved his work." ... "He was a tough boss but well respected by his loyal employees, which there were many throughout the years. He expected perfection and wouldn't settle for anything less." ... "In Lieu of flowers please place a hefty bet on your favorite sports team in Nick's name and/or donations to Holy Trinity Cathedral."

"Also back then the clubs never had three turntables, just two, but one night Nicky had this dream... He was playing records and this sound effect was playing during the mix. The next morning he ripped his home turntable out and took it down to the Gallery and within six months, every club in New York was using three turntables. Not many people know what to do with three turntables, but Nicky sure did !!!"

Have fun today.
