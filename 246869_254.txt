Why do people have such reactions to celebrities? Why must we "love" or "loathe" famous people? Can't we be simply indifferent?

"If you have any talent, or any occupation that delights you, do it, and do it to the hilt. Don’t ask why, or what difficulties you may get into. If you are an average student in everything and no intellectual pursuit gives you real delight, then I don’t know how to advise you." - Richard Feynman

From the Sennacherib Prism: "In the midst of the high mountains I rode on horseback where the terrain was difficult, and had my chariot drawn up with ropes: where it became too steep, I clambered up on foot like the wild-ox."

You can be unhappy and still have a sense of humour. But I do think that a lack of a sense of humour is a serious red flag, in anyone.

'Online Emulation of Soviet Ternary Computer Setun' - yes, a counting system with base three.

"There is something insane about a lack of doubt. Doubt, to me anyway, is what makes you human, and without doubt even the righteous lose their grip not only on reality but also on their humanity." - Tilda Swinton

Thomas Bennet: "I once met Grace Hopper. As in the creator of COBOL. She was doing the rubber chicken circuit when I was in college. She passed out nanoseconds, which are pieces of wire the length that light travels in a nanosecond. I wish knew what happened to mine." I'm not sure what the 'rubber chicken circuit' is.

"Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They're too stupid to be able to read or write. Besides they wear black, which is such a beastly colour. I'm so glad I'm a Beta." ... "Alpha children wear grey. They work much harder than we do, because they're so frightfully clever. I'm really awfully glad I'm a Beta, because I don't work so hard." - Brave New World

Stephen Clark, Bob Coecke, Edward Grefenstette, Stephen Pulman, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh: "We discuss an algorithm which produces the meaning of a sentence given meanings of its words, and its resemblance to quantum teleportation." With some odd mis-spellings. Could be a hoax? "Does it work? The proof is in the pudding."

Have a good day.
