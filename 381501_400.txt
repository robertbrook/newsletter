Good morning.

Episode 400. My goodness. Around two hundred more to go, I think. And around thirty things on Fading City. Of course I don't have anything to say, but it's my right to say it!

I should press ahead, but not now. It has begun raining. Serious, night-time rain. I shall begin again in the morning. I will type until I have to stop.

Perhaps people are feeling the cold. Perhaps you're all like my knees.

Really, BBEdit loading packages from Dropbox is obvious but still fiendishly clever. Well done.

Google says this route I'm walking should take an hour an ten minutes. It takes me an hour and a half.

Many people are admirable not for the successes others attribute to them but despite the failings they attribute to themselves.

Someone is whistling the 'Imperial March', rather half-heartedly. I could do a much better version.

My goodness, guns being fired are often so much louder than I expect.

I wrote something about passing 40. It's okay.

I'm double-clicking. Why is this happening? What's wrong with me?

Back in a minute. (I just have to go to a meeting (about a meeting (about a meeting.)))

... "A cup of coffee is worth more than almost every app on the store." - Surely "priced higher"? - "... we should be aware of the fact that we're in the business of creating products which offer very little value to people." I think I'm getting my head around this, but it still sounds weird. Everyone wants to have an app, everyone wants to make an app but no-one wants to pay for an app? So what happens next? "If there is a good enough free alternative, most users will stick with it." Free apps are 'good enough'; is that all?

I closed my App.net account. I'm not a social animal, clearly.

I just saw a grown man eating 'Monster Munch'. Not that I'm judging. Oh no.

"The action is with him on that."

Have fun today.
