"A man's mind grows narrow in a narrow place, whose mind is enlarged only because he has lived in a large place: but what is got by books and thinking is preserved in a narrow place as well as in a large place." - Samuel Johnson

"Mit dem Wort bestialisch ist der Geruch treffend beschrieben, der Geschmack ist einfach nur widerlich. Scharf, bitter, beissend, säuerlich. Niemand aus der Runde bekam es hin, mehr als geschätzte 5 Gramm in den Mund zu nehmen."

"I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements." - Stephen Hawking

Leila Johnston is hugely, hugely under-rated. She's one of those rare people who step forward alone, not always following in other steps. Her work is experimental in the proper sense, nothing footling or without meaning or discovery. Do yourself a favour, take some time out and read this. Leila's work makes me both want to give up typing right here - and also never stop.

Just two minutes!

Zoe Wanamaker on acting and her parents' opposition to it: "It's a vicious business, it's cruel, it's demanding; also it can be very humiliating. [They] didn't want me being hurt because it's full of rejection, so I think they were just being loving."

Have a lovely evening - and a good day tomorrow too.
