A south London correspondent quoted Lao-Tzu at me. I'm not sharing that.

Russell Garner pointed me to a video of Anil Dash on 'The Web We Lost'. I still haven't written my thing about this.

Is prayer asking, a request? I've never felt the urge.

My best code isn't as interesting as John Graham-Cumming's bugs.

I'd seriously consider abdicating in favour of my son. I think he's great.

How to save water: don't over-fill kettles, use a dishwasher instead of washing up by hand, shower for less than seven and a half minutes, use washing machines a lower temperatures. Wait a minute - "On average, Britons shower 4.4 times a week, and take 1.3 baths"? I don't understand. Aren't there seven days in a week? Do I sound weird now?

That last Guess-Who was - of course - Joan Plowright.

And here's another Guess-Who: born in 1860; lived in an orphanage for 14 years; fraudulently promoted Australian gold mines; founded a newspaper, apparently to further his schemes; charged with "conspiracy to defraud"; made bankrupt, several times; spoke at recruiting drives for the First World War - in Trafalgar Square at at the Royal Opera House - with considerable success; defended himself many times in court; founded the forerunner to the 'premium bonds'; toured music-halls after prison - where he was too big to fit in the regulation uniform - in a one-man show ... "reduced to telling his stories at the Windmill Theatre in the intervals betwen the naked girls", where he had a heart attack on stage; died very poor; his cremated ashes were left in an urn for four years before being collected by his nephew - and his mistress, a former chorus girl.

"The single had a slightly odd music video, which featured the band all lying along a pool side in winter, as they are tended to by a frog waiter; a diver who is reluctant to jump into the pool until the end; and human-size hot dogs appearing by the pool side, dancing during the chorus."

Have a lovely day.
