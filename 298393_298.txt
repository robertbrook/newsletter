"Our cushions are Vegan" - okay. I do like this cushion, though.

I'm still thinking of my visit to Brighton Museum. Thérèse Lessore actually lived in Brighton. In the opinion of Walter Sickert: "I cannot see her pictures going out of date."

The excellent James Hague: "When it comes to writing code, the number one most important skill is how to keep a tangle of features from collapsing under the weight of its own complexity. ... To a great extent the act of coding is one of organization. Refactoring. Simplifying. Figuring out how to remove extraneous manipulations here and there."

I know this is all supposed to make PHP better, but I still miss when it was just - you know - PHP. Not that there's anything wrong with namespaces. But, well. I'm sure it'll be great.

A thing in Ruby, a server, that helps you write Tumblr themes. Tumblr is still there, isn't it?

"The film revolves around a serial killer who murders women while using a portable movie camera to record their dying expressions of terror. ... The film's controversial subject and the extremely harsh reception by critics effectively destroyed Powell's career as a director in the United Kingdom. However, it attracted a cult following, and in later years, it has been re-evaluated and is now considered a masterpiece." Wow. Talk about a turnaround.
