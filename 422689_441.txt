I someone wanted - for example - to install node(js), or mongo(db), or Forth (Hi dad!) on their Mac; I'd recommend "homebrew". The installation and maintenance are certainly a bit odd if you're used to the App Store, but brew is still the least awful way of doing these things.

I am listening to Autechre. Erasure are still going, too. I remember, long ago, flipping through racks of CDs in Virgin Records on Tottenham Court Road - and recognising the person hovering at my elbow as Andy Bell. I made some rather glib remark like "Don't worry, I'm sure there's some of your stuff still for sale!" - to which he offered a rather defensive smile and a light-hearted curse. You know, I'm sorry I said it. I should have said "Hi Andy - I love your music and it's great to see you!" ...

... Andy Bell suffered from avascular necrosis and had both hips replaced: "the skeletal support goes, you're holding on to things. I saw the Queen Mum's surgeon. It takes a while to be able to walk, about three to four months per leg."

Years ago, again, I met Lucien Freud by Mornington Crescent tube station. He was carrying a crumpled Tesco bag. In fact, he looked like someone doing an impression of Lucien Freud. I nodded a hello and he looked a but taken aback.

My blasted notes aren't syncing. These people have hijacked IMAP, damn their eyes.

I have redesigned my website. Stop chuckling. Okay, I've "redesigned" my "website". There.

I'm looking forward to Saturday morning. At least, we're aiming for Saturday morning.

"You listened to DJ Yoda this week. Want to try Roni Size?" #spotify #algo

I'd like to see a film.

Then a couple of weeks back, I passed Brian Sewell, just by the St. Martins' entrance of the Portrait Gallery. He looked his age and was on crutches, helped by a couple of assistance. I'm glad I at least said "Hello Mr. Sewell!".

I'd not ask for an autograph or a chat, but saying hello is okay, isn't it?
