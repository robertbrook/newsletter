A pleasingly direct and presumably accurate one-line-bio from Matthew Daly. "I'm a web developer in Norfolk."

I don't have this, "the absolute need to understand". I'm still thinking about what sort of work I'm able to do. Don't get me wrong, I do stuff. I have a job and everything. Well, I have a job. But I don't share what programmers have. But, neither do I share what managers have. I've most often seen management described as, pretty much, making other people do things you don't even believe in yourself. I don't think I could do that. I've no urge to tell people what to do. We end up with "leaders" modelled on primary school teachers. Bad primary school teachers.

Theseus' boat. The boat of Theseus? Is that it?

I was on a bus, okay. I think it looks great.

I wish I could write shorthand. But then, I have no reason to know shorthand. So there's that.

This code is crap.

The Apple Podcast app has lost that laughable UI, but still doesn't make much of the metadata attached to most podcasts. Show notes, links, chapter markers?

I still think that Apple will eventually head back to something like OpenDoc. iCloud documents might be the beginning of a revival of document-first working. Rather than app-first.

I've been troubled by the ground-swell of posts from dev folk railing against iCloud. Until recently, I didn't care: after all, everything I use that sits on iCloud works fine - and I'm not a dev person, so implementation wasn't my problem.

But recently, there's been more volume, more people pointing out that if devs don't like iCloud then users like me won't get nice things. I want iCloud to work. I assume Apple does too. And Apple developers. iCloud not working means what - back to Dropbox? That would be okay, wouldn't it?

Leaning in? I think I get it. Sounds weird though. Being ambitious, I suppose ...

... but you can't be "nice" and "successful" anyway.

Feeling weirdly up-beat for a moment there. The ups are as disconcerting as the downs, though. It'll pass.

"... a cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python."

I suppose if I fret about "Sign in with Facebook" and "Sign in with Twitter", I should feel at least as uneasy with "Sign in with GitHub".
