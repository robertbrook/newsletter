Joely Richardson: "In this tight little society, her Ellida bristles like an animal in a cage. When a dark figure from the past returns to take her away, you can feel her excitement about where her passions may lead her as well as her apprehension."

The odd thing is, am I envious of Deming, or Boyd, who I read again and again? No, I'm not. I admire them and I'm grateful for them. Do I not envy them because they're dead? Well, it can't be that. I don't feel envy towards Merlin Mann, or Mark Bernstein, or Jordan Morris - all of whom I admire and enjoy the work of. Those three are much under-rated, I think.

What upsets me is not an excess in others but a lack in myself. That I have been given most every opportunity and resource, yet I've not done enough with it. Why should I be envious of others or begrudge them their achievement when not only have they done as much with less than I have now, but what they do takes nothing from me? I should only celebrate what they have done and applaud it.

Thinking about a recent 'Roderick on The Line' - people get Merlin in to tell them things they don't usually hear. But, they have to take that step. They have to want that to happen. In most corporate situations, one might ask the question "Is everyone okay with this?" - and, if they are, then there's no problem. I mean, no problem for that group, that company. If the people who own the company, or the people who run it and are responsible for the outcomes - if they're settled to how things are going, then that's that. Right? Right. You can't solve someone's problem if they don't think they have a problem.

Of course, when you put that conversation in a wider context - for example, what about the people working there who aren't in the boardroom, or the customers - then things might look a little different. But there you are, in the boardroom. And it they don't have a problem, then there's no problem. Am I missing something?

I suppose you could persuade someone that there's a problem. One they've not previously seen or wanted to acknowledge - and your job might be to see that and point it out. Another approach might be to suggest solutions to unacknowledged problems.

Have fun today.
