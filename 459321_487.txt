"When I was quite a little lad / At Christmas time we went half mad / For joy of all the toys we had, / And then we used to sing about the sheep / The shepherds watched by night; / We used to pray to Christ to keep / Our small souls safe till morning light - ; / I am scared, I am staying with you to-night - / Put me to sleep."

... "In the blue wardrobe of Heaven there are many unused clothes, too tight fitting, yet too beautiful to throw away. And in that wardrobe we hang our likenesses - yellow diaries, yellowed with yesterday, thumb-smeared with tomorrow.
