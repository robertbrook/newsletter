The arguments against AirBnB - and similar 'disaggregating' services like the taxi apps - seem to be two of a kind. That AirBnB isn't paying to run a service similar to others who do pay to run that sort of service - and that AirBnB is, in some way, doing something bad. There's a civic arms race between cities enforcing existing rules and the same cities trying presumably, to allow for 'innovation'.

Flickr seems to be slowing to a crawl. Or timing out completely.

Thanks to @marxculture. Mahesh Sathiamoorthy works out what language Github types use most often at the weekend. "... Lua, D and Arduino seem to be some of the most popular languages during the weekend." Lua I know of, D I had to remind myself of - and I thought Arduino was hardware.

I'm absolutely exhausted. I'm too tired to sleep. Oh dear.

Reading RSS in Devonthink, from a book by Joe Kissell.

My goodness I can't stand Apple's address book, contacts, whatever it's called.

Via Dominic Tinley: the 'Gulf of Corryvreckan Whirlpool'. Wikipedia reminds us that "Orwell's one-legged brother-in-law Bill Dunn was the first person to swim the gulf". I think I can float, but certainly not swim.

At least I'm moving towards horrible things I recognise. I know how they work.

Time Machine seems to have dropped off the network. Hm. Reboots all round.

"Enjoy yr large twatacino." Honestly, the language on Twitter nowadays.

I don't feel that good. I can't sleep. That doesn't happen very often. It makes me feel terrible. So here I am, up very late - for me - mopping up email.

Via Liz Conlan: "some low base notes of funk from the ethiopian Gedeb". Also, a yo-yo.

Yes, I do still love my iPad Mini. I don't miss the bigger iPad's 'Retina' screen, though I thought I might.

Via Giles Turnbull. Add a few zeroes to the price of Tom's excellent project and you'd have a perfectly presentable Enterprise Telepresence System.

Have a lovely day today.
