I do believe that it can be a duty to be happy. Perhaps it is your duty.

When I ask myself what I'm interested in, I can certainly say 'the philosophy of computing', but that's not quite it. Something that's not philosophy and something that sits in the middle of computing, technology in general and society. So what, conceptually, is the file system? Why are we making decisions about it? What will be the result of coming away from the file system? What will be any effect of us clinging to it? Does clinging to any form of technology mean anything? "... I wanted to put the idea out there. Honestly, not expecting much if anything to come back. But this is just a blog, and just a post on a blog. Nothing earth shaking." Just a guy in a room.

Actually I don't feel entirely well. I'm sure it'll pass. It usually does. You know that thing where people say "you should drink more water"? I should probably drink more water.

This is a photo of the corner of Wild's Rents and Long Lane - at least, I think it's called Long Lane - in Bermondsey. It didn't look like this at all more than a decade back, when I first saw the flat above what was then a derelict fried chicken shop. I think someone I knew lived there already - and when I decided not to move it, another friend ended up living there. Of course the whole place is much more done-up than it was. Strange to think that yet another friend just happened to be passing to take this photo.

I forgot what I was going to write here.

The Tinder-Box, by Hans Christian Andersen, 1835. "The soldier immediately cut off her head, and there she lay on the ground. Then he tied up all his money in her apron. and slung it on his back like a bundle, put the tinderbox in his pocket, and walked off to the nearest town. It was a very nice town, and he put up at the best inn, and ordered a dinner of all his favorite dishes, for now he was rich and had plenty of money."

Enjoy today.
