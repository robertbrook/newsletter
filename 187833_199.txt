I look absolutely ridiculous with my hair grown out like this. It should always be short. Short short.

Supermarket Tesco buys restaurant chain Giraffe. They also own most of a coffee chain, though I forget the name. Interesting idea. Perhaps they've reached brand saturation, but this would let them carry on expanding covertly. That wasn't me saying Tesco is bad, or good.

Still too inward-looking. Must look out, out. Cold and bright.

Squarespace Commerce is US-only, right? And still no video hosting. I should look at Vimeo Pro. I'm finding VideoPress unconvincing.

"Am I overthinking this?" - pretty much everything on Ask Metafilter. But, in a good way.

I went through the Hyde Park Corner underpass for the first time ever recently. I'm forty. And exhausted

Does the Google Reader shutdown mean the end for RSS? No, but it does mean that fewer are caring about RSS. The succession is an in solved problem. It won't be Atom Plus. It might just be JSON - and leave the format wars to the front end dev. Streamed data is a 'back end' thing for most people.

Reading about Linux users. They're people who "don't like to pay for software", apparently.

Even doing awful things takes time.

Some of the user names on Reddit are just amazing.

I had an argument with my dad recently - a heated discussion, I suppose - about ... something. Anyway. One of his points was that I should speak more directly. That I should avoid euphemism and analogy. What worries me is that I might simply sound awfully rude.

Listening to episode one of 'Back To Work' again. Yes, of course Merlin sounds a bit fruity, but it's still good.

I'm voting. Voting! I like voting.

... also this: "whereas [spelling checkers] mostly try to find errors by comparing all words to a built-in dictionary and flag the word as an error if they can't find a match, Fowlt is context sensitive."

I'm tired and cold.
