"A noun or pronoun, with a participle in agreement, may be put in the Ablative to define the time or circumstances of an action. This construction is called the Ablative Absolute ..."

"CriticMarkup is a way for authors and editors to track changes to documents in plain text." Hmm. Seems a bit florid.

Asked about building a simple site on a Mac, by anyone not wading through code, I still recommend Sandvox - and Squarespace.

A 'companion' to AngularJS - not just UI elements. Not sure how I feel about Angular yet. Some people argue that the Google backing is a bug, others a feature.

Martyn Loughran's APICache: "Itâ€™s also got a handy syntax if all you want to do is cache a bothersome url." Useful.

Rambo Amadeus: "His songs combine satirical lyrics on the nature of common people and silliness of local politics."

I was going to point to something about turbo-folk, but I don't have a firm enough grasp of Serbian civics.

Korona deli, on Streatham High Road. I used to live nearby and was a regularly devotee of Korona's cheesecake. Recommended.

The Lancet, 1868, on 'The Victoria Wine Company': "We wish the company success in making their wines popular, and in deflecting the current of sound port and sherry into channels hitherto flowing with deleterious brandy and corrosive gin."

"Four formats wrestle with each other for web glory. By their acronyms we shall know them: HTML, XML, JSON, RDF. Sometimes they clash, and sometimes they merge, forming weird and wonderful hybrids. Is there any way for them to work together?" - Jeni Tennison on 'Collisions, Chimera and Consonance in Web Content', at XMLPrague, 2012.

Brooke Palmieri interviewed in 'Fine Books' magazine: "There is a copy of one of Jean Bodin's (many) works on witchcraft: Le Feau des Demons et Sorciers on my desk at the moment. It's the latest of several books on witchcraft and magic we've acquired, including Reginald Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft, a book that argues with Bodin."

David Starks writes: "English speaking people will know that there are 26 letters used in writing, but they will have no idea how many phonemes there are in their speech. ... Received Pronunciation has 46 phonemes, but most other English accents, and practically all foreign languages, have less than this."

Listening to Bobby Womack. Nice.
