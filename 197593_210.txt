Steve Lawson's book "Rock And Roll Is Dead" - "All the Twitter and blog content in the book was ‘real’ - it was posted to the web as I went along, and the Twitter responses are real responses from real Twitter users – none of that interaction is ‘faked’ (other than the characters being fictional… if you see what I mean.)"

Cubase flashback. Weird.

"... I’m already rocking a grand of powder a month ...  I jumped on it like a bunny on a carrot ... Burge is this big old fat guy with a ring of hair around the side of his head like one of those olive branch crowns Caesar wore. ... I started hacking together code like a Wall Street Jack Kerouac." Er - what?

I know there has been some recent pushback against annotated source as documentation - but, look at this thing. It's great.

"If you are building apps, just build one for Steve’s devices, and one for Android, and be done with it. If it is a web app. you already know it would work everywhere, so you are good. ... When you just have two platforms (platforms that matter, anyways) and one platform says it cannot encourage technology ‘middlemen’ (Adobe) on its platform, the world of developers has no choice but to forget portability and other such good things."

Via Dave Briggs - Tony Hirst discusses linked data, ends with The People's Front of Judea. Of course, "If you want to join the People's Front of Judea, you have to really hate the Romans."

I am tired of all the outrageous posturing. But, more delighted by those who genuinely work and contribute to more than just themselves. You lot, the workers, the quiet toilers. Don't worry so much about the yellers, as I do. It's a waste of attention. Onwards, with your work, with what you make.

Just knowing that there are beautiful things in the world, is enough.

Anyway. I'll see you tomorrow.
