Hadley Freeman on Beyonce and feminism: "Knowles rightly hates the fact that women are humiliated by being paid less than their male counterparts. But they are similarly humiliated by being fed the message that it doesn't matter how successful, powerful or smart you are – all that matters is how sexually available you are willing to make yourself look."

Wireframes I never liked, nor screenshots. Give me running code, however crappy. "Playing with drop shadows, gradients and pre-designed sign up forms might be fun for a complete beginner but when you're a serious designer trying to design complex user flows, these toys just get in your way."

Alex Howard on US House data in XML. "...  here’s hoping that the entire Congress takes more steps to make the content and status of proposed laws more accessible to the hundreds of millions of people its members represent around the country."
