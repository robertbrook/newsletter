Still I feel increasingly uncomfortable about the ads for 'gentlemens clubs' at Vauxhall. I'm not sure why. It just creeps me out. Maybe I am a prude after all.

North Unst lighthouse on Shetland, by Muckle Flugga: "The most northerly lighthouse in the British Isles ... The tower was constructed by D and T Stevenson, over a hundred people working on site between April and November 1856."

I think I should like to go back to Berlin.

Radical innovation at Milk Bar on Bateman Street. Every time they have a refit I dread coming back in to find the place changed beyond recognition. The latest rejig is a bit more adventurous than usual. You know me, I'm not one for adventure, especially in coffee. They've knocked a pound of the prices, which seems awfully suspicious. There's little red cushions. That's very suspicious. And worried that the whole idea just won't work - that I might come back in a month and find they've finally gone under.

I shouldn't worry about these things. People know what they're doing, don't they? The experts? After all, I'm not an expert. I should just let them get on with it ...

... but then again, here's Bryan Goldberg with some stern advice for the Bitcoin enthusiasts: "... stop trying to be an economist. Youâ€™re not an economist." I still have an underlying fear of anyone who's especially sure of themselves, who won't admit doubt.

Innovation. Governance. They don't fit we'll together. And this isn't the best coffee I've drunk this week. Things could be better, certainly. So, what am I going to do about that?

1805: "Barbadoes Packet, Smith, from Africa, is arrived at Demerara, after beating off two privateers near that colony."

I'm enjoying Racket, but find myself falling back into non-Racket practices now and then. Things like wanted to make hashes into objects rather than just address them as hashes. I'm also suffering from 'pyramid code' - where you end up having a dozen nested calls, similar to some node.js stuff I've written. I'm not yet sure how to escape from that. I need some sort of callback hook without having to write all that code. I'm not sure if that makes sense.

Dear friends, onwards.
