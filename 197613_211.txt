I think one of my problems is that I have no particular love for data - nor am I entranced by technology.

I wish mobile Safari let me "send to Reminders". Oh well. I suppose Apple decides what Apple lets me do.

Ridiculously, I still think of putting together my own little language. I could prototype it using Jison, I think. I could just make all the silly mistakes everyone else did decades ago. But I think I might enjoy doing that. Every time I think "Why doesn't it work like that?" I can just find out the hard way. For example: includes. Why not have a language that does 'hot' includes? I mean, the first time you call a library it's included? Like I said, silly mistakes.

Here's a proper little language: arc. It uses Scheme as a VM, sort of.

Alan Kay on computing as pop culture: "... pop culture holds a disdain for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating. It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future — it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from] — and the Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made. When was the last time a technology with a scale like that was so error-free? The Web, in comparison, is a joke. The Web was done by amateurs."

Evelyn Waugh on Churchill: "a master of sham-Augustan prose ... no specifically literary talent but a gift of lucid self-expression ..."

I may start 'blogging' again in May. Not sure. Maybe. Nothing to write about, obviously. "The goal isn’t to generate art or invent new philosophies; the goal is to improve your ability to communicate and increase your sphere of influence." Hmm. I've pretty much given up on communicating - and I'm not into 'influence'.

Have a good day.
