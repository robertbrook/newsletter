"The Blue Room is decorated like British aunts in the 1980s used to decorate their sitting rooms. Across the window are drawn a pair of heavy curtains that never get opened. In front of the window is a bed, made up professionally like all hospital beds, with the sheets and blankets pulled down crisply into rectangles, all the corners perfect. A pristine pillowcase sits below the headboard, untouched by human heads." Well, I wouldn't have imagined that. But then, what would I have expected?

"The popularity of the Winnie-the-Pooh series is down to the characters, and the way in which Milne depicts them.

Me and Autechre go back a long way. I'm discovering them again.

I remember people saying "There are no bad children, only bad parents". Now that sounds like "There are no bad people, only bad ... people who ... who are not the person you first thought of. Or something."

I saw someone wearing a beret today. Almost as if they meant to.

I am becoming increasingly convinced that my aching knees are the result of one or more people sticking pins in a crudely formed waxen effigy of me. Nothing on NHS Direct about that diagnosis, though.

What if people really meant what they said to you?

Shall I bother doing anything with the newsletter archives? That might be fun.
