A friend recently reminded me that not doing something for fear of someone else doing it better was, at best, rather silly. At worse selfish and terribly self-absorbed. Well, we've already established that.

Those medium.com URLs are almost deliberately - what's the word - obscurantist? It's nice, in a way, to be able to say what you do, what you're good at. But it can also, under certain circumstances, be limiting. Maybe you were hired with that Job Title, but you've done a fair sight more that that, haven't you?

We all have a voice, some voice. Some have a voice they don't even want to hear themselves.

I'm still tweaking the layout here. I know the plain text version has those awful tracking URLs in it. I'm trying to get rid of them. I just can't work out how to turn them off quite yet.

Ah well, it was good while it lasted. Back to the email.
