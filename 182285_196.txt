There's a wifi network in 4 Millbank called "SAURON". Maybe not today.

I was lent a copy of this book - on Mother Teresa - recently, by someone I think has some vestigial religious faith. I don't. That doesn't mean I rejected the book, but the whole thing is just stuff I don't have in my life at all. I don't refuse the faith of others - but many people do seem to expect it in everyone. Some of us aren't searching for meaning, or indeed anything. Some of us don't feel absence, or loss, of ... whatever it is people with faith actually hold to, or feel. The most interesting thing, for me, is that what causes seemingly terrible pain in some - the crisis of faith - is everyday life for others, with no pain felt.

"513 Centesima is a fairly small minor planet orbiting the Sun. ... It's small size immediately discludes it from dwarf planetary status; it is too small to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, and since there is no natural satellite in orbit around it, it's mass will remain a mystery, unless a satellite is spotted. Also, due to being small, like most asteroids, it probably is a cold and geologically dead world, though heat from a collision and, although more than likely false, tidal heating from Eos and other members of the family could leave slight remnants of an almost-but-not completely undifferentiated body." Bit sad, really.

" ... what one or two lone hackers can readily achieve today, once could only have been accomplished by a team of engineers, business analysts, project managers, and QA testers, with tools purchased from vendors that employed legions more engineers, analysts, project managers, and QA testers ..." - followed by an interesting conflation of 'machines' and 'software'.

I'm back in the cafe. Someone is learning lines. A couple whispering about social networks. Two of the staff speak a language I thought might have been Czech, but turns out to be a dialect of Polish spoken in the south. It didn't sound like Standard London Polish.
