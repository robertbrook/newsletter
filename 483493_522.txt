Good morning.

A little more on Len Wincott, of the 'Invergordon Mutiny', prompted by Paul Clarke. Joe Jacobs remembers, 1974: "I got to know Len Wincott soon after the mutiny, and saw him off when he went to the Soviet Union in 1934. ... remember that many of Len’s views are coloured by the fact that he suffered a great deal more from some of those he came to regard as his ‘friends’ than he ever did from his known enemies." ...

... Len wrote of his father: "A well-oiled strap dangling from a nail at the fireplace was a perpetual reminder that the booze-angered deity did not forgive." ...

... Simon Fowler: "He survived the Siege of Leningrad and ten years in the Gulags where he met and married his fourth wife. Wincott finally died in Moscow in 1983. His ashes were scattered over Devonport Harbour."

I forgot the glasses. Glasses, of a kind.

I've been so led astray by Apple's delightful sales techniques the going back to a Thinkpad is increasingly perilous. No, I don't want a Lenovo Yoga Flexipad. Yes, I do want to see a laptop in real life before buying it. No, I don't want to have to choose between options I can't understand. #firstworldproblems

I'm going to put my time into Vagrant and Docker a bit more. Vagrant and Docker will save me.

Recent job postings from both the BBC and the Guardian mention Scala.

I've been writing a little utility in 'literate' Coffeescript and generating documentation with docco. It's like living in the future. Amazing.

Annie Williams: "Her foregrounds are a few simple objects, usually pots, and backgrounds are created from textiles or old newspaper cuttings, and even some unfinished paintings as a starting point." Thanks mum.

I still think 'Mavericks' is an odd name.

Enjoy today.
