There are so many JavaScript - er - things. So many of the things. There was a site where you could compare languages doing stuff. It was called Rosetta Stone. I think. Anyway!

"Unix pipes for the web" - docs too thin, waiting list for signup. Let's see where we are in a week. "I am not an executive at Yahoo so I wonâ€™t get a chance to grow Pipes passed its awkward adolescence to the beast it could have been. I am, however, doing the next best thing: I am building Factor." And yes, the blog is on Tumblr.
