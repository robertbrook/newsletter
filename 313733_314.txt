Thank you to both Lloyd Davis and Liz Conlan for letting me know that 'traps' can mean "the percussionist's set of contraptions", "instruments, such as snare drums and cymbals, especially in a jazz band".

The slightly silly name aside, it's quite a nice place.

A co-worker suggests we might properly consider "focus and caring about outcomes rather than chasing arbitrary distractions like targets, quotas and reporting cycles." A friend adds "I think it's reasonable to blame technology some of the time – when in all good faith you believe technology can do a job but it turns out the technology is in some way flawed – but if you decide to use Technology X and fail to deliver it's more than likely you're at fault for choosing Technology X in the first place and not Technology Y."

"On Sunday night, that spy led a group of appoximately 15 Pandemic Legion supercarriers, including one of the three extant Revenants in the game, into an ambush. The spy/FC took the PL fleet to a midpoint, then jumped them into the middle of a Black Legion POS in Odamia system in Placid where a fleet of Black Legion dreadnaughts and supercarriers were set up, waiting." #spoons

'Apple's App Store is populated by many "zombie" programs which get next-to-no downloads, new research suggests.' - New research? Just take a look at most search results in the App Store. Who would want to download them? Somewhat depressing.

I've not the energy to do all the things I'd like, so the things I'd prefer to do in parallel must be done in series. A long, slow series at that.
