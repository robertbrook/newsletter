446 - DIAMONDS

On the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)

Morning folks.

Sorely tempted to going back to text files for everything. Perhaps no mobile computing next year. I'm getting a bit put out by having to carry what amounts to an Apple device, or a Google device, or a Windows device. What about a me device?

I have a terrible pile of mail to get through. Excuse me one moment.

If you downloaded my little application called 'Thinkabout', I'm sorry about the error message. I'm not sure how to fix it, but I am trying to. I think it has something to do with the file path. It assumes that you want to read a text file at "/Users/USERNAME/Dropbox/Documents/thinkabout.txt" - could you try running it again after checking that path?

I am laughing, a bit. About a thing, in a place. I was told that someone had a theory to explain my actions, generally, that I had a 'Napoleon Complex': "an alleged type of psychological phenomenon which is said to exist in persons, usually men, of short stature. It is characterized by overly-aggressive or domineering social behaviour, and carries the implication that such behaviour is compensatory for the subjects' stature." [Thanks Wikipedia] I'd never really thought about it. I mean, I'm quite aware I'm shorter than most people my age, but it had never occurred to me that I might be one of those "driven by a perceived handicap to overcompensate in other aspects of their lives."

More Forth now.

Forth, written in Perl ...

... and in bash ...

http://ppcforth.sourceforge.net
... "PPCForth is also rather small, weighing in at under 30K of code for everything, and under 10K for a bare-bones bootloader." ...

http://www.forth.org/compilers.html
... non-commercial Forth compilers ...

http://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Forth
... a few more up-to-date links at concatenative.org: a very enjoyable site, too ...

http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ForthLanguage
... but this is the most comprehensive link-dump, on the original wiki. "Please, please - some Forth addict clean up this page, eh? There are dead links and links to more dead links. Let's not let Wiki devolve into a repository of useless clutter, shall we?"

Factor isn't a 'modern Forth', but a fascinating new concatenative language ...

http://planet.factorcode.org
... you should check out the Factor Planet aggregator.

That's it with the Forth.
