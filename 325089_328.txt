"Chumby Industries closed its doors in December 2011, and laid off all of its employees. Since then, the service has been maintained by a small group of volunteers, and paid for by a succession of companies. The volunteers were notified that the funding would cease at the end of February, 2013, with the prospect of the devices being rendered completely useless."

I loved Birdhouse. It got sold to Brizzly, I think. Then something something AOL?

Fogus suggests a series on 'Computer Science' - though I don't really like the term - in the style of the excellent Dover reprints. This whole things needs a funnel. You know: identify stuff, or writers; sign them up and publish. That would be a publisher, obviously ...

... Hayward Cirker started Dover on $200, but avoided "pulp romances and detective novels". Found a market, or made a market? "Mr. Cirker still visited the Dover offices three days a week until his death; Mrs. Cirker went there the other two."

I was going to post a link to a thing, but the story started to get political. Not going there.

An 'inverse calculator'. Oddly, putting in '2' doesn't result in '1 + 1'. '4' is apparently best known as the square root of four divided by twenty-five. Huh?

Charles Stross on his tour of the Torness power station: "... the [Pressurized water reactors] have won the race for commercial success: they're much, much, simpler. [Advanced gas-cooled reactors] are like Concorde - technological marvels, extremely sophisticated and efficient, and just too damned expensive and complex for their own good."

This is wonderful. All the 'insides' of making a film, in this case the excellent 'A Field In England'. "Warning! All content in the masterclass contains spoilers."

Chicago Public Library's "Maker Lab", which opened recently. Are there any similar library-labs in the UK? Seems like a great idea.

"Trapped in nets, forced to surface and scuttled under gunfire" - a saw footage of a dive to this wreck recently. The ship seemed well-preserved, a sad reminder of how war-wrecks are often just underneath us.
