Good morning.

"Longest shownotes ever." Lloyd does the shownotes, obviously. The shownotes are incredibly detailed. Fractal, possibly. I'm trying to submit the podcast to iTunes, but Apple insists on some 'cover art'. Er - any suggestions?

"This sleek, high-performance wristband is with you all the time, motivating you to be more active."

Oh my goodness a new subscriber. Erk.

When Lloyd mentioned 'Banjo Kazooie' I assumed (1) he was joking or (2) he meant 'Crash Bandicoot'. I'm still not sure ...

The last few 'bare' .uk domains: the British Library, the JET Joint Undertaking on fusion power, the Ministry of Defence, Nominet, the National Library of Scotland and the office.

"An open forum to ask prominent members of the government technology community (almost) anything." Maybe I should find a hobby.

The remarkably comprehensive OpenCorporates API. I often refer to this. You know, for research purposes.

Have fun.
