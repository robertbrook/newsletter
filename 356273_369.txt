Guess Who! "At age twenty she was the youngest registered owner of a Rolls Royce in the country." Appeared on a Smiths cover and a Beatles cover. Said in an interview with Mike Wallace in 1957: "... I hate going out. In fact, in England I never go out at all. I don't like nightclubs, I don't like going to premieres, or going around what is commonly known as the sort of smart places to be." Appeared in a last film, in 1985, with Vanessa Redgrave and Sarah Miles - and five other women.

What a great URL from Hasbean there. One thing that's always puzzled me: why no mobile UI?

I'm a big fan of clickable iCal links - you know, things that link straight to an .ics file. iOS deals with them pretty well. Lanyrd does this fine, as does the excellent traintimes.org.uk - but Google Movies and the Southbank Centre don't, amongst many others. Seems like they should.
