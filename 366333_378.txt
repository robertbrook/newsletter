Good morning, internet friends.

The whole Apple monitoring chip thing: the M7. I still don't quite understand the benefit, to me, of measuring how far I walk, or whatever. I'm sure other people are interested in that, but I'm not. Again, perhaps I just don't get it. There's a lot I don't get, but I don't usually let it worry too much. You'd end up driving yourself mad.

I hate talking on the phone. Absolutely hate it.
