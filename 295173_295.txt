Good morning.

A nice guide to Sinatra with Postgres on Heroku, with code runthroughs. Michael Herman recommends: "Start with a basic dynamic website, backed with SQLite. Create and manage your database tables with raw SQL." I'm not convinced that the raw SQL is actually something you'd absolutely need to know.

I think it's time for a cup of tea. My keyboard has told me as much.

I've not seen 'The Sopranos', but I did really like 'In The Loop'. Gandolfini was great in that.

And now I'm listening to The Smiths again. I'm not sure if they're in fashion or not at the moment - and frankly I don't really care. I don't like everything they did, but the good stuff was very good. I think.

Breakfast: "Boiled white rice mixed with raw egg; bread roll; green tea." Lunch: "Small bowl of rice; nimono vegetables (potato, daikon radish, carrots, taro root); thinly sliced stir-fried pork and bean sprouts; miso soup; green tea." Dinner: "Sushi ... green tea." So - lots of green tea, no coffee and no sugar.

Knee complaining. Slowing down.

'Jo namagashi' - "The delicate glutinosity and understated sweetness go well with the astringent taste of green tea." #DelicateGlutinosity

The email is piling up again. Lots of replies due. Later today, will have to do. I'm sorry if you've had a long wait. I'm not very focused.

This is great. Glass recycling, in six GIFs. Gets around that internet video format nonsense.

I wrote this about organisational culture. I don't know very much, for sure, but I think and have opinions so that will have to do for now. If I stuck to "write what you know" it would be a short, dull exercise.
