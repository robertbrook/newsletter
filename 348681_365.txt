This article from David Geary, on 'HTML5 components', is making it a little clearer for me to understand. "Currently, two projects provide Web Components polyfills: Polymer and Mozilla X-Tags. Polymer only works with Chrome and requires a web server to use HTML imports, making it unsuitable for production use. X-Tags works with nearly all modern browsers and doesn't require a web server; however, X-Tags only implements the custom-elements API, leaving out templates and Shadow DOM."

I watched 'Silent Running' for the first time a couple of months ago. I must say I found it quite odd. Larry Klaes writes: "My strong feeling is that this message is what the audiences who saw the film in 1972 and afterwards got stuck in their brains; this is why we continue to hear the tired (and wrong) old mantra of 'Why do we spend money on space when we need it hear on Earth?'" - 1972? This thing's as old as me!

"I think the Marinara Pizza may be many pizzaiolos favorite to make. It is a pizza pie with no cheese and I think reflects the skill and passion of a pizza maker's ability to evoke deep flavors from such simple ingredients." Franco Manca pizza is pretty good. Pretty good.
