A century!

I heard some young folk using the word "moist" in conversation recently, in a rather notable way. Yes, I did look it up on Urban Dictionary, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. In the parlance of our times: "To be referred to as moist is to say you are ill informed or have said something idiotic or embarrassing. Moist can also be used to describe a situation or occurrence. If someone is faced with a circumstance that is particularly displeasing it's also acceptable to say something like 'rahh that's moist'." You learn something every day.

'Sophie Calle in conversation with Melissa Harris': "When you do a portrayal, you ask people to describe the whole body, not only the eyes. So to have a portrait through these different angles, itâ€™s the way to have a more complete portrait." ... " What I was interested in is: Do people see the absent work, or do they see a piece of material? What do they see inside the frame? In a museum, a frame is rarely empty."

The excellent drummer Sarah Jones: "Often I play beats that have already been written and recorded.  In those cases, I just adapt them to be played live. With Hot Chip, we change up the songs quite a lot for the live versions, which we all come up with together in rehearsals. In my other projects, I usually write the beats. I really enjoy coming up with electronic beats in the studio, too."

Anyway, I shouldn't forget this.
