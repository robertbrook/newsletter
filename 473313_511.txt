"The 36 are simply too humble to believe that they are one of the 36." - from Rabbi Raymond A. Zwerin's Kol Nidre sermon, 2002. Or, I think, others identify them and they refuse it.

Roberta Cowell, who died in Twickenham at 93: "a racing driver, a Spitfire pilot and a prisoner of war" ... "the first known person in Britain, and among the first in the world, to undergo pioneering gender-reassignment surgery". Diana spoke of her father - "He stood up for himself, ...

Alex Reynolds' writeup of Evgeny Morozov's lecture, with responses from Richard Barbrook - my old lecturer at the London College of Printing, as was. No, I never saw him without the hat. "...

The authorities were not amused." Most of the supposedly British officers were played by South Africans. The Zulus played the Zulus, who "found themselves re-enacting the deeds of their own grandfathers."

I may have posted this before. Apologies if I did, but it's wonderful: "This site tells the 'then and now' story of living and trading on Gloucester Road in Bristol from the late 1800's up to the present day."
