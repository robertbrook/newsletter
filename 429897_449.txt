I'm pretty much racing on Night Nurse now, so.

I'll just leave this here.

Is there something that can tell me when a particular thing might become available on the iTunes store? Not just 'recent releases'.

I'm letting a couple of things expire. It's the right thing to do.

"Payment is accepted only through a valid Paypal account. All identification details in this account have to be valid or we will have to shut down your service." Classy.

My laugh reminds me of my dad.

'Thinkabout' isn't really my idea, it's from Giles Turnbull. I'm just writing an application that sits over that file.

"Telenor will launch their first Firefox OS phones in Central and Eastern Europe this year. Firefox OS phones will launch in more markets later this year." - thanks to Russell Garner for reminding me.

"The real sad part is that the majority of those making negative comments are simply following the voice of the few in a bid to be accepted. Human nature. Animal nature. Just as wild dogs follow the alpha dog."

It feels like someone is calling me.

"I treated myself to some ginseng."

I still have that cold. Awful. Awful.

Do people still have matte paint on their cars?

You know what, let's not have that meeting.

I have discarded Anubis and anointed Anubis 2.
