This is great, but. How about a bald node js version? Yes, I realise it's about frameworks, but people use just node sometimes, don't they? I'm sure I saw something like that recently.

Can I tell you about something I like? "Then I woke up with the fork and mash hanging off my lips ..." - I like the bit where Giles talks about his cassettes. Cassettes. The Internet is so old now ...

"Tales is design to scrape the web continuously, even when the domain being scraped blocks the scraper server ip; it goes around this problem by fail-overing to a new node ..." - runs on AWS and Rackspace.

"People try something, meet with success, and then attempt to apply that formula over and over again, failing to recognize that new problems require new solutions." Every few years, someone re-invents John Boyd.

I'm suffering from a ridiculous idea at the moment, something to do with saving bookmarked URLs to PDFs in Dropbox. I'll get back to you on that one.
