Good morning.

I'm using a 'text factory' in BBEdit to help markup the URLs rather than doing it my hand. I hope it all looks pretty much okay, but please do let me know if it looks a bit weird. You can mail me at mail@robertbrook.com.

Motorbikes and hovercraft on the Goodwin Sands. And the "Goodwin Sands Potholing Club".

I think I've been wagging my tail too much. I might try something different.

Everyone's got their reasons.

Something to experiment with using Backbone.

Four kids busking near the Festival Hall. Saxophone, clarinet, another one. They were great. I gave them something under two quid.

"Coke machines"?!

Does Foursquare still exist? I might start using that again. Wait a minute. No iPad app? I tried it for a day and it felt a bit ... old-fashioned, strangely.

Ian Wylie's photos of T. Adamou and Sons' last day.

What's that land north-west of Gallions Reach Park? By the river?

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_International_railway_station

I want to ask Tom Morris about various things, but I'm too scared to mail him.

I'm reading about "hyperlists". I think there's something there, but it feels wonky. Logic and markup squashed together. Like s-expressions, ish?
