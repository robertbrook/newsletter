Merlin mentioned this film recently. It absolutely haunts me. Every couple of years it looms back up in my memory. "This was [Rene√©] Falconetti's only major film and over a period of a year under [Carl Theodor] Dreyer's direction (a combination of cruelty and patience), her extraordinarily expressive face made for one of the greatest, most harrowing screen performance." ...

... Roger Ebert's review: "For Falconetti, the performance was an ordeal. Legends from the set tell of Dreyer forcing her to kneel painfully on stone and then wipe all expression from her face - so that the viewer would read suppressed or inner pain."

Issue 222. I rather like that.

"He slopes in, long and loping, in a white T-shirt, dark jeans and jacket, trainers and shades, blingtastic lion medallion hanging down his chest, patchy Rasta beard, and surprisingly beautiful."

I think I might be slightly missing the point of CoffeeScript. It's Javascript shorthand, right?

From 'The Forest Road Reader', on Barack Obama and David Beckham: "I've no idea what relationship the two men have, but I assume passing acquaintance at best."

"The Managing Director and CIO have given the Innovation Management Team in the Office of Innovation and Technology latitude to try new things." Hmm. The language needs to move on from this.

Hearing this more and more: helping people means just giving them money. "Recipients use transfers for whatever is most important to them; we never tell them what to do. To date recipients report using transfers for a wide variety of purposes including buying food, investing in their homes, paying school fees, buying livestock, buying land, and buying clothing."

"Admiring the abundance of choices but at the same time frozen with indecision and the fear that the branch will break when I set out to pick one of them." My goodness, too much inward-looking! Not everything is there just for you. And this isn't me criticising James personally, but expressing my view only.

"The British Geological Survey states that about 12% of current world gold production finds its way to [the tech industry], where it is often used in such small quantities, in each individual product, that it may no longer be economical to recycle it." Recycled gold. I suppose everything is recycled, eventually.

And have a lovely day today.
