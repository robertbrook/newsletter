Tantek and other are still pushing the #indieweb idea forward, but will it be the end of the weblog or the beginning of something new? Aren't those "digital sharecroppers" just too big - and attractive - to be resisted? I mean, why run your own website when you can post to Facebook?

It's a way off yet, but save the date. "Rather than posting content on third-party silos of content, we should all own the content we're creating. Publish on your own domain, and syndicate out to silos." IndieWebCampUK 2013 is in Brighton, 8th September. Tantek and Tom Morris and more.

Jerry Sadowitz: "Who's to deny anybody their comedy? You can't say that one person's strand of comedy is OK to laugh at, but this person's isn't.

Angela Todd: "Your Humble Servant Shows Himself: Don Saltero and Public Coffeehouse Space" [PDF] - again, apologies if I've posted this before. I have been enjoying reading it. "Keywords: masculinity, curiosities, coffeehouse culture". Right in my wheelhouse, as Merlin would say.

Tanja Cilia, on Lent: "In my childhood, I remember a friend of ours serving turtle (it was not yet illegal to do so then) because she said it lived in the sea, and was therefore a fish. This, of course, exemplifies the ways we play about with the 'rules' in order to do what we like."
