"At first she dreamed of sheep, of going to school, of cats drinking milk. Little by little she dreamed of blue sheep, of going to school in the middle of the woods, of cats drinking milk from golden saucers.

You cannot access items that you pushed on the return stack outside some definition or loop within the definition of loop."
