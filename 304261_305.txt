Marguerite Young: "I see Emily Dickinson quite often, ... Virginia Woolf, and Dickens. Poe, oh, all the time. I see him on misty nights at Sheridan Square when the rain's falling. He's going into a little cigar store to get a cigar. I am on very close terms with Poe."

"A Few Figs from Thistles: Poems and Sonnets by Edna St. Vincent Millay" - "The Prisoner": "All right, / Go ahead! / What’s in a name? / I guess I’ll be locked into / As much as I’m locked out of!"

The steamer 'Norge' struck Rockall on 28th June, 1904 - around a century and a decade ago - "Clanging bells signaled crewmembers to stop the engines. Pumps were engaged and passengers were instructed to put on life belts. Lifeboats were readied and passengers began to board them. The nose of the ship was pinned directly against the rocks. Captain Gundell ordered the engine room to reverse the engines to pull the ship off. Unfortunately, the damage was sever and as soon as the ship was away water began pouring into the hold."

I've been listening to an old episode of 'Inspector Morse' on the wireless. It's from an interesting world - no Internet, no mobile phones. 'File' means a folder of A4.

"All the president is, is a glorified public relations man who spends his time flattering, kissing, and kicking people to get them to do what they are supposed to do anyway." Harry Truman - ha! 'Leadership'!

So, so tired of this obsession with 'innovation'. Are we any more or less 'innovative' than at any other time? Oh dear. It's not me, really.

I feel quite distant from people between about 15 and 35. Anyone else at least I have a chance with, but this lot feel unreachable. I wish it wasn't like that, but I can't pretend it is. Kids today and so on. They have their own world and I'm not part of it, entirely understandably.

Onwards.
