"She is not a despot. She will always listen (albeit with an icy smile which freezes all but the most intrepid) to any complaint about the running of her household. She will not jump the queue at the butcher's, although she will affect not to notice if the queue moves nervously to one side to let her pass. She always has a word for the neighbours' children, and it is not her fault if they sometimes repeat the word to their scandalised parents. It would be going too far to say that Queenie has a heart of gold. Perhaps a heart of brass would be nearer the mark."

We had a cup of tea. We should have taken a photo. I'm going to start doing that. I'm going to start taking photos of me, with you. Volunteers, please?

When I was young, I had a book about Monopoly 'strategy', which now I think of it was simple common sense, facts and tables of probabilities. At the time it seemed like the Monopoly bible. Then, at the time I thought playing Monopoly was great. Now, I can't think of much I'd like to do less. Truman Collins: "Just as I finished putting together this web page, I realized that there is a more efficient way of making the probability calculations. It would have been better if I had created a larger Markov matrix with three entries for each square."
