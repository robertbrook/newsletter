Edward Platt: "Leigh Fermor lost the first three diaries he kept as he made his way from London to Romania, but he rediscovered the one that covered the last section of the walk soon after he finished the draft of A Youthful Journey.  It was saved by his first love, Princess Balasha Cantacuzene, a Romanian aristocrat he met in Athens in 1935, and lived with until the outbreak of the Second World War."

"I just wish someone would find it in their economic interest to do for Ruby what V8 did for Javascript." "... stick with Rails, the framework will give you the training wheels you probably need.

... "Remote work is not about working more hours in more places. It’s not about invading every crevasse of your life and stuffing it full of work, work, work."

Onwards.
