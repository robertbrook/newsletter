Good morning.

I get enough of this IRL.

Sometimes I get really enthusiastic about computers and the web; other times it just feels like a dead end.

I didn't write a colophon.

For a little while, @fadingcity was alive on Twitter. I just don't have the heart to keep it going. Twitter feels too alien a place for me now.

Fargo.io is moving too fast for me to understand it at the moment. I'm going to leave it for a few weeks and see how it looks later.

Arthur Miller, in the heat: "Babies cried in the darkness, men's deep voices murmured, and a woman let out an occasional high laugh beside the lake." ... "Broadway had open trolleys with no side walls, in which you at least caught the breeze, hot though it was, so that desperate people, unable to endure their apartments, would simply pay a nickel and ride around aimlessly for a couple of hours to cool off."

"Both World Wars gave rise to concern about the possible effects of a direct bomb hit on the tube lines passing under the Thames. During World War I, steel frames were fitted in the Bakerloo Line tunnels at Embankment and Waterloo stations; these could be filled by hand with wooden baulks, a task taking nearly an hour."

I've stopped using Flux and just taken to turning down my screen brightness.

The Waterloo and Whitehall Railway: "For working the traffic an engine situated at the south side of the river would drive one or two of Mr. Rammell's patent ejectors, which would alternately withdraw air from and force it into the tube, in advance of or behind the piston carriage. The area of tube would be such that a pressure of one ounce to the square inch would give a tractive force of about 900 lb., more than enough to produce sufficient speed for a train of 15 tons."
