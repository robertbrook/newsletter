Anne Applebaum describes the writing of Anna Politkovskaya: "... thoroughly unsentimental and didn't romanticise things at all. She just documented the story in a cool fashion. She did an amazing story about the shocking, slovenly system of what happens to the bodies of Russian soldiers after they die, about how little anyone in the system cared."

"An ancient variety, in the literature of board games called 'Anglo-French', is the game played on the 8x8 board in, among other countries, Great Britain and the USA. A much more evolved variety is 'Polish draughts', today often called 'International Draughts'. ... Polish draughts is the farthermost developed variety. Not only because of the larger board ... which allows more complicated combinations: the Polish variety is played with a long king (doubleton) and the singleton can take in backward direction."

"At noon on Dec. 30, protesters in central Kyiv held mirrors in front of police for 30 minutes to commemorate the night of Nov. 30 when riot police used excessive force to breakup a peaceful rally on Independence Square consisting mostly of university students." Events have moved on considerably from late December, of course.

Another site I used to visit often, pleasingly very little changed. "It would be a weird series of paintings to see exhibited together - a series of portraits, say, of earnest people standing at windows and sitting on chair, each with a different product of the XYZ fast food chain that particularly accentuates that person's mood."

Robert Beaken: "Within weeks of Edward VIIIâ€™s accession, it became apparent to Baldwin, Lang, and others that there were problems with the new king, who was behaving erratically and was utterly dependant upon Mrs Simpson. Letters of complaint began arriving at Lambeth Palace."
