Yotam Ottolenghi: the complexities of contemporary parenting.

I'm writing my airline story next week. It's not about an airline and it's only a few thousand words - barely a story. It's a thought I had, years ago, about a thing that happened years before that. I'm not sure why, but it's stuck in my mind for all that time. If I write it down, perhaps I can leave it there. I'm not really a story writer, but I shan't worry about that. I shall just give it a go and put it on the web. I think airplane story makes more sense than airline story. It's still not about that, though.

"As the last Destroy All Software screencast (at least for now), this one is weird."

A Guess-Who, suggested by a south London correspondent. Named Daniel after his father, who's nickname was "Shrimp". His mother came out as lesbian and lived with 'Uncle Evelyn', who paid for Eton. He joined the navy and got the Atlantic Star. He was an extra in 'Hamlet', with Lawrence Oliver. Then fame beckoned. In his most famous later role, he wouldn't use a gun. He lives in La Jolla and is "an avid nudist". Ring any bells?

"Squeaky trucks are an audibly annoying problem that can be easily remedied by simple application of household soap to the pivot cup of a set of skateboard trucks." I've not had the problem myself, but this might be useful.

I wrote something called "Rewriting London". It's pretty mournful, even for me.

I'm glad it's raining. I'm so glad it's raining. The only people I trust are those who don't trust me. The only people I listen to are those who have despaired. And thank goodness I'm not burdened with any idea of intelligence.

Have a lovely day.
