Good morning.

Strange ups and downs recently. Fuelled by work stuff, people, music, the weather, you.

MongoDB hoster proclaims the death of the DBA! "They will automate or die." #shocker

I had another idea. I'm going to write it down now.

Antony Easton's writes his sister Lynne's obituary: "... one dog she brought back from Lanzarotte was so fazed by London that its first walk was also its last. Once off the lead, it never returned. It was the dog's mistake."

"I’d like to have coffee to bounce an idea off of you and in exchange I'll tell you all about what we learned about ..." #yeesh

"Rick’s a machine whisperer - a kind of mechanical Confucius of the desert. He understands machines so well that his fixes come across as magic." I don't like this angle. People are people. There's no magic. There's no need to pretend there is. The whole world is people, physics and attention.

My feelings regarding Chilly Gonzales remain unresolved.
