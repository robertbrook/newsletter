I was reading this story on the BBC website on a desktop computer - and my eye was caught by the updating ticker-box thing on the right side. I poked around in the source code - something that's still possible, for now - and made some guesses about what it being used to do it. My guess: a node server running pulsar pushes out JSON-P chunks than the page then renders through a mustache template. No, really. That's my guess.

"Depending on your age and interests, you will know Mikhail Baryshnikov either as one of the most graceful creatures that ever set foot on a stage, in the same league as Nureyev and Nijinsky, or as that Russian bloke from Sex and the City."

"Written during a time of emotional turmoil, Ulvaeus has admitted that the recent divorce between Benny and Frida was at the back of his mind during the songwriting process for this song. Bj√∂rn sought approval from Benny and Frida before the group began working with the song. When recording began in March 1981, only one month had passed since their separation."
