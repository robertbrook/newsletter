The bread-and-butter pudding from the 'Milk Bar' on Bateman Street is, I'm afraid, nothing to write home about.

A wonderfully concise diagram of time functions.

I think my continual feeling of deja-vu must be a combination of me leading a remarkably repetitive and pedestrian life - and my dreadful memory. Either way, troubling.

PhoneView, recommended by Merlin Mann, I think. A file browser for the iPhone, pretty much. From the same people who brought you Printopia and Call Recorder for Skype. I tried and did not love Printopia, but then I'm not the sharpest knife in the box when it comes to config.

I recently shifted from Instacast to Downcast. Downcast points me to dar.fm as a way to record radio streams. I admit the site design weirded me out a bit.

Seems like I'm not the only person wondering why a calendar is published in RSS.

"'Death Of The Family' explores why Joker infinitely defers his triumph, and why Batman is not just morally constrained in letting Joker live." I still prefer TPBs. Does anyone know when the fourth TPB of American Vampire is due out? From 'the bottom half of the internet': "an overly bombastic arc that failed to credibly answer any of the central questions burning away at the center of this extraordinary modern myth", "... pacing was awful, there was a distinct lack of tension ...", "nothing special"

"Hate Week is celebrated in late summer. The events during that time include waxwork displays, military parades, speeches and lectures. New slogans are also coined and new songs are written."

"Here he is at Dior's spring/summer 2003 show sporting a full head of feathers and a very bald chest" - I'll never have a chest like Galliano.

"It was an amazing view to see naked people running during through the snow in this beautiful hilly rural landscape." I don't want to think about this. I only want to have my happy thoughts.

[Thanks to Ben Woodhams.] David Lloyd: "The usual product of the big companies still governs the core comics market to the same degree that it always did in print publishing and retail, which I regret, ... But things are better on the whole. Creator rights have improved dramatically since the 70's of course. We didn't have royalties then, couldn't make special deals, [you] couldn't even get your artwork back from publishers then."

More tomorrow.
