St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics: "The patients were housed in single cells, which had no heating. They slept on wooden bedsteads with loose straw (those considered incurable were only given straw). Many of the windows were not glazed but had iron grates, and shutters which were closed at night. The Hospital had two 'airing yards' - gardens for use as exercise yards - one for male and one for female inmates. The most dangerous patients were kept inside the building or locked in their cells."

"I called it 'Music in Twelve Part's because the keyboards played six lines, there were three wind players involved, and I had originally planned to augment the ensemble to bring in three more lines, for a total of twelve. I played it for a friend of mine and, when it was through, she said, 'That's very beautiful; what are the other eleven parts going to be like?' And I thought that was an interesting misunderstanding and decided to take it as a challenge and go ahead and compose eleven more parts."

"Yesterday I shot 367 photos. When I got home, I immediately deleted 147 of those." ... "Facebook is, sadly, where real humans that you know will see, and engage with, your photos. Being humans, they are only interested in pictures of other humans. Never put a picture of the Eiffel Tower on Facebook. Only pictures of people."
