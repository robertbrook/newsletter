The 'block' design of this lovely early computer reminds me a lot of the amps I used to like when I was younger: Mission Cyrus. Cyrus still make amps - and other hifi bits - that look like shoe boxes ...

... only the One and Two series, though. The other newer ones look too shiny.

Dominic Tinley offers a translation: "The Entente Cordiale Brighton England" - but what's that last bit? I thought it might have been a date, but apparently not. Any ideas?

Today, by my calculations, is again Monday.

It's probably unfashionable once again to claim to like the music of Conlon Nancarrow, so I shan't admit to that here. Peter Bates: "Along with Conlon Nancarrow's Studies for Player Piano, Kaikhosru Sorabji's Opus Clavicembalisticum is one of the 20th Century's longest piano works. At almost four hours, it is certainly the longest single work that a human can play." ...

Jules Schwartz on 'The Development of Jovial' - a language apparently named after Jules Schwartz. "Since I was standing in front of the room conducting the meeting at
the time, somebody ... suggested it be called Jules' Own Version of the International Algebraic Language. This suggestion was met with laughter by the assembled group. ... I left town for a trip soon after. Upon my return I found that the IEC people had put in the performance contract an obligation for SDC to develop the language called JOVIAL ..."

A strange smell, again, but this time, sharp, like wood.

I switched from Google Mail to Fastmail some time back. Here's a guide from Max Masnick on how you can too. He agrees with Marco Arment that Google's IMAP service might well be next on the chopping block.
