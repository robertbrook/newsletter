A helpful correspondent from the US recommends 'Little Miss Matched' for socks: "They sell socks in groups of three, all different, but all coordinated." What an excellent idea!

"You are born open, curious, and loving. The world you must navigate is fear-based, suspicious, and reserved. You become frightened, anxious, and protective of self."

"Two or three o’clock in the morning ... The sky is blue. Dawn is breaking. Down there, a little way off, they slaughtered cattle, cows bellowed, and I painted them. I used to sit up like that all night long. It’s already a week since the studio was cleaned out. Frames, eggshells, empty two-sou soup tins lie about higgledy-piggledy ... On the shelves, reproductions of El Greco and Cézanne lay next tot the remains of a herring I had cut in two, the head for the first day, the tail for the next, and Thank God, a few crusts of bread." Marc Chagall, from his autobiography.

Yeats speaks on the debate on the 1926 Coinage Bill: "The official designs of the Government, especially its designs in connection with postage stamps and coinage, may be described, I think, as the silent ambassadors of national taste."

"You won't find a new country, won't find another shore. This city will always pursue you. You'll walk the same streets, grow old in the same neighbourhoods, turn grey in these same houses." Constantine Cavafy, 'The City'.

Today, a Guess-Who from my mum. Someone born in Poplar in 1925, who's father was both a member of the Communist Party and sometime mayor of Poplar. After her father and grandfather's death, her mother took her from London under the Blitz to America. In the 'Samovar Club', she first worked at 16, claiming to be 19. Later, she and her mother got jobs in a department store, but her mother was fired. Still only 17, she appeared in her first film as "a conniving cockney maid". Any ideas? As usual, I'm missing out all the important bits.

I hope you'll have a good day today.
