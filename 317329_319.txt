The issue with things that appear to be "better than Dropbox" is that many applications, both desktop and mobile, assume you're using Dropbox. Some even assume Dropbox before or instead of the presumably available iCloud. So it doesn't matter how good the new service is, if you're not visible in-app, you're not visible at all.

This goes for Apple's "share panel". Presumably the service there are visible because Apple wants them to be. Flickr, Twitter, Facebook. When one of them falls out of favour, as I imagine is inevitable at some stage, it will fall off the panel. A strange world.

A game. The most interesting part is the file engine.js - "MICHAEL IS A LAZY BASTARD AND DOES NOT WANT TO REFACTOR". I think Michael's done very well.

Someone throwing a knife at you? "This throwing business does create something of a timing problem, for, if you fire after he has thrown his weapon, you may have difficulty convincing a jury that you fired in self-defense since technically you were not in jeopardy if your former attacker is no longer in possession of a deadly weapon."

I've steered clear of Volcano coffee for a while. I'm not good with new things. But it's growing on me, in cafes. I really want to visit their roastery - it's in an old electronics factory. I worked there, years ago, after it was converted to industrial units. I used to seep the floor in a wood-working place - and move around huge slabs of hardwood.

If I liked Kanye West's "Yeezus", what else might I like?

I hope you're bearing the weather.
