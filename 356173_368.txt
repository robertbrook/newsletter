Good morning digital chums.

I unsubscribed from something today because I found the content offensive. Perhaps a better word would be inappropriate. Or distasteful. Anyway, not for me.

Recently on Portland, I saw a bumper-sticker with a crossed-out bunny, with the legend "KEEP PORTLAND WEIRD". Here's another nod to Tinderbox. Keep software creative.

Still, every time I get something recommended as "it looks like iOS 7", I try it, I hate it. I've become that guy. Maybe I could do a year without iOS, while it all calms down? Mavericks looks fine, though. I can deal with that.

Tyler Cipriani's dotfiles: "Awesomer than the combined powers of a ninja, Batman and Santa Claus!"

Siracusa mentioned recently that he thought Apple wanted to be a "devices and services" company. Again, I get nervous. Everything walled-gardened and gatewayed? And what's my alternative - Ubuntu? I need to get serious with arch linux again.

"There is no great difficulty in measuring the length, breadth, or height of any figures, where the parts are made up of plain lines. It requires no more skill to take the dimensions of a pillar or cornice, than to measure a square box, and yet the man who does the latter is neglected, and he who accomplishes the former, is considered as a miracle of genius; but I suppose he receives his honours for the distance he has travelled to do his business."

Another successful Guess-Who spotted: that last was Doris Day - spotted by Jez Higgins.

"The park itself has spooked people of the public in the past few years. There had been sightings of Elizabeth who had died at the age of 18 whilst ridding a horse, the story told is that she was on her horse and went to the woods, this is where a fox spooked the horse and dropped Elizabeth of his back and Elizabeth broke her neck and died. till this day her ghost and her horses ghost still stay existence." Okay then.

Have fun.
