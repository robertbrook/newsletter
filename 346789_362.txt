Good morning friends.

I used to read Wes Felter's 'Hack The Planet' years ago. Tumblr's fine and everything, but it's not the same.

"A nice question, arising out of the now defined orthodox doctrine of One Person and Two Natures in Christ, came before Hormisdas for settlement. There being but one Personality in the Incarnate Word, and that Divine, it seemed correct to say that this Divine Person suffered, and yet to say this seemed to attribute passibility to the Godhead. It was undoubted Nestorian heresy to deny that lie Whom the Blessed Virgin brought forth was God. But He Who was brought forth was the same with Him Who suffered on the Cross." I've been listening to a lot of podcasts.

"Se le suele representar como un hombre que vaga por las calles cuando ya ha anochecido en busca de niños extraviados para llevárselos metidos en un gran saco a un lugar desconocido." The sack man! I would have been terrified. I'm slightly terrified now.

"The first year, we drove down in his car, almost falling asleep and crashing on the way. We slept in tents that year. The second time, I came down on my Bonneville and just drank Carlsberg 68 for two weeks. The third and last visit, I drove down in my Mustang which was cool and then locked myself out in the car park after I arrived before breaking back into it with a coat hanger." ... "Hopefully in the due process of time it will be possible to build a history of Skewjack from the early 'anything goes' days, to the last dying moments as the camp closed for the last time and the new owners dumped thirty tons of rock and mud in the gateway to deter unauthorised entry."

Another rail to airport scheme that failed. I must admit I'd never even heard of it until recently.

You're joking, surely.

From 'The Telegraphist', 1885: "On Sunday the probationers are supposed to go to a place of worship, having to sign their name in a book to the effect that they have been to church; the rest of the day generally being taken up in reading and walking."

Have a lovely day.
