"On one outing to the Colony Room with the artist Francis Bacon and his boyfriend John Edwards, Susan Elliott was handcuffed to a barstool by Edwards, who went off home without unlocking her. She made her way back to north London and managed to get into bed beside her husband without disturbing him, concealing the stool by her side of the bed. Denholm Elliott set off for filming the next morning none the wiser, and she then hailed another cab to take her to Bacon's studio in Reece Mews, where she was released, and then taken for lunch to Wheeler's, by her captors."

"It from bit. Otherwise put, every 'it' - every particle, every field of force, even the space-time continuum itself - derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely - even if in some contexts indirectly - from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits." - John Wheeler, 1990
