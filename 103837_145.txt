Embedded tweets now with more stuff, "to better understand engagement". Surely Twitter can't want to control every quoted tweet presentation? I suppose if they push the idea that it's not just text - and you can't cite it with a URL - then that's where it's heading.

Hmm. The peanut gallery. Comments on Hadley Freeman's Guardian story of the 50th anniversary of Sylvia Plath's death: "I am not sure that those who label Plath's work as self-indulgent or misery laden have read any of it."; "... she seemed to savor her own misery as though that melancholy was her raison d'etre."; "Marrying a poet was where they both went wrong"; "The problem with putting poets, artists and composers on a pedestal is that they are people, not angels."
