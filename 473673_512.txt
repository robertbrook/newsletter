"At Moon Lake Lodge, one dinner guest found chef Crum's French fries too thick for his liking and rejected the order. Crum cut and fried a thinner batch, but these, too, met with disapproval. Exasperated, Crum decided to rile the guest by producing French fries too thin and crisp to skewer with a fork."

"The Sistine chapel ceiling is large ... It took Michelangelo 4 years of work. He used throw-away prototypes, he did a little revision (iterative development) and he worked in increments. I didn’t find evidence of him doing serious iterative development (read: revision or refactoring), but OK, he’s recognized as a genius for a reason."

Jörg Kantel, on Fargo and CouchDB: "Doch bei näherer Betrachtung ist CouchDB mit dem JSON-Dokumenten so etwas wie ein modernes Frontier." It's a pity Frontier isn't a modern Frontier. "Natürlich müßte Winer Fargo dazu unter eine Open Source-Lizenz stellen, damit man an die Quellen herankäme und sie anpassen könnte." Fargo is 'public', but not open, I think? Would Concord be enough?

Thea on Haddock: "The Haddock Directory is a Yahoo-style catalogue of websites which are posted each day to the London-based Haddock mailing list." The past, though.
