Morning folks.

Thrown back into exhausted revels, music, words, surrounded.

"Perry now sees his indulgence in drugs and alcohol as the stage of his journey where he lacked the confidence to recognize himself." I've seen Lee 'Scratch' Perry quite a few times. I'd say I was a fan, yes. His latest stuff with The Orb is fantastic. "As our session of verbal jousting drew to a close, Perry’s crazy persona relaxed and gave way to allow a shy man and a gifted artist, one who at once loves and shuns the marketplace, to emerge. At this stage of his life, delivered from the demons and disappointments of his past, Perry appears grateful to be exactly where he is. 'Ask and you shall receive. And I asked for and have received so much,' he said." Wonderful!

I'm cruising the aisles on Spotify looking for easy beats.

Adam Kennedy reviews 'Duppy Writer', from Roots Manuva: "weed-and-Guinness riddled science". And 'Buff Nuff' is great.

The time's off, just there. Why did he do it?

An amazing retake of butoh, without being patronising. Really very good, I think.

I keep pushing it back. Along with several other things. Anyway, another push.

"Tails is a live operating system, that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card." Just saying.

I absolutely love Michael Nyman, still.

"At the end of our practice presentation Paul Graham said that the only thing he could remember about our pitch was that our product makes people scream."

Have fun today.
