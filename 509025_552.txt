"Watch the video" - if I must. Click. Nothing. #pfft

Really, there's no good time to say "Actually, I'd prefer if you called me Robert". Not Rob. you asked for my name and I said Robert. I didn't say Rob. It's not Rob.

Would I "recommend" tai chi? Well, of course I wouldn't recommend anything, since I've no expert knowledge to make any recommendation in the light of.

Do I enjoy tai chi? I'm never really sure how to answer any question that includes the word "enjoy". I am content rather than happy. I am absorbed rather than enjoying. I don't tend to do things with the aim of enjoying them. I tend to do things for evident utility or necessity. Or the avoidance of pain.

My personal theory is that gymnastic exercise is for the young, only teenagers if they're already years into the practice. Athletic exercise for teenagers and young adults: any weight-bearing or impacting exercise only under training or direct instruction. The so-called "external" martial arts would be these sorts of thing, together with any regular gym-visiting.

Doing these things past your mid-thirties should only be done by people who know what they're doing. And there are people who know what they're doing. You might be one of them. But you might not. Once you hit forty, you're in maintenance mode. Well, that's what it was like for me, at least.

Older adults: "internal" martial arts, like tai chi. Older still, I expect qi gong is the only proper thing.

I exclude from all of this, deliberately, any yoga forms; since I simply know too little to take a view.

And, yes, I'm sure there are fifty-year-old boxers and seventy-year-old weight-lifters, but expecting things to turn out that way for you might be wishful thinking.

None of this is me giving advice, of course. I only started doing martial arts pretty much by accident. I stopped joining in team sports as soon as I was able to - and I'm no athlete. Even the very mild exercise I do now I find difficult, now and then. Mainly the knees.

Maybe you'd like tai chi. You should try it.

But also ow my knees.
