I tried running 'Contacts Cleaner' on my Mac. That was a mistake. Merlin was right: contacts are a mess. A boring and unprofitable problem though, since no exciting project seems to have chosen to solve it. Of course, a few have tried.

The Codex Arundel, a da Vinci notebook. The image viewer is pleasingly simple.

Fascinating materials for 'hackers' - I still feel a bit silly using that word. I wonder if there are comparable UK suppliers? I can't imagine it would be easy explaining what 'Levitating Pyrolytic Graphite' is to the local parcels office.

There was an effort some time ago to export personal account details from bank's awful websites. The aim was to end up with your own account information in comma-separated so you might be able to do something useful with it. Unfortunately, I couldn't persuade homebrew to install it. Might tweak the formula ...

... here's a web and command-line extension of the ledger idea. Again, I didn't get it to run. I'm going to write my own thing just to throw CVS account files around. I'm not looking for much, after all. Maybe I could write it in Rebol.

Trying to get into node and express again. I can't quite work out the difference between 'npm install' and 'npm link'. I'm sure it'll all make sense eventually.

"Do parents of bad kids like this know when and where it all went wrong? Do they care? Do they even acknowledge that their kids are hell spawns?" - a bit of a sad read, rather than just depressing or angry-making.

A rather odd article from the BBC on horses in Romania. A angle, I suppose? "We relived every moment of the slaughterhouse in the TV edit room and censored out the pictures which would turn the stomachs of even the brashest British carnivores - then ingested the best remaining cuts into the belly of the British Broadcasting beast."

I am neither a plain speaker, nor a good speaker. I agree with Ed Smith here, though: "Using plain and clear language is not a moral virtue, as Orwell hoped. Things aren’t that simple. In fact, giving the impression of clarity and straightforwardness is often a strategic game. The way we speak and the way we write are both forms of dress."

Have fun today.
