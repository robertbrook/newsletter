Vol. 2, No. 583. "THE PENNY".
Good moaning.

My latest #firstworldproblem - I often have to connect to the internet from 'restricted environments'. That's fine, it still works, but; services like Basecamp assume quite a bit about connection speeds, caching and reliability. My connections are somewhat complex, hopping as they do from one firewall and caching layer to another. The result: Basecamp's snazzy nested caches just start unravelling. Have I edited this document? Have I just saved a blank page? What happens if I refresh?

I'm going through this document taking out as many of the "scare quotes" as I can.

I'll never really feel safe.

I am listening to someone read out the Declaration of Independence. The American one, that is. Personally, I didn't find it boring at all; on the contrary, it was very interesting.

We should change how we employ people: instead of saying "this is what you should do at work" we should say "this is what you should (help (us)) make at work".

Here's a Huffduffer link to another podcast from Lloyd Davis and Dave Briggs. I really like Huffduffer and I'd welcome suggestions for more people to follow ...

The chap opposite me on the train is eating a samosa from a plastic tray with gin and tonic from a tin.

Time for a reminder of the excellent 'Good Postcard Club' - penpals for the internet age.

Assuming that everyone you've hired is both smart and gets things done has interesting side-effects.

21st May, Dusseldorf: "The web is more and more converting to a monoculture. Big global players like Google, Facebook and Co. control every part of our digital life and build an alternative web of walled gardens." Also, Jeremy Keith will be there!

My scratchy Coffeescript thing actually works now. Off for a cup of tea.

"Copies your Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ posts to a blog, with all formatting and details intact."

And now, the electricity bill.

I get Coffeescript and I do prefer it to JavaScript, not because it's better but because I'm lazy. I still want to use Perl 6, but where can I run that on a server?

And now, a hair cut. Woo!
