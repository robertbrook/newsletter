If you're reading this on Friday, it's the last day of the 2013 outing!

"The latest innovations in content discovery are game-changers." Hmm. I'm not sure quite what that might mean.

The official 'gazette' of Romania.

http://orda2000.narod.ru/row/vita/balasa/sabin.htm (http://orda2000.narod.ru/row/vita/balasa/sabin.htm )
The 'Atlantida' paintings by Sabin Balasa. Quite odd.

http://www.ontotext.com/owlim (http://www.ontotext.com/owlim )
"a family of semantic repositories" - used by the Beeb, I think.

http://www.emilsoman.com/cloudster/ (http://www.emilsoman.com/cloudster/ )
A ruby gem to generate AWS CloudFormation templates: cookie-cutter cloud farming.

"The Bay Lights is an iconic light sculpture designed by internationally renowned artist Leo Villareal. This stunning fine arts experience will live for two years on the San Francisco Bay Bridge West Span, starting with the Grand Lighting on March 5, 2013."

A little disconcerting to read dear Francis referred to as Onion-style "Man".

A mail client for the Mac! Great! But, surely we could have some screenshots?

"Playing 10 minutes with a flying simulator will make you more comfortable maintaining the airplane in the air but won't help you on landing."

Dan Pallotta: "People are suffering from a crisis of meaning, and not in small part because the definitions of meaning have been re-engineered by a culture confused about it itself." I'm not convinced. Maybe I've missed the point he's trying to make.

http://yongfook.com/enterprise.html (http://yongfook.com/enterprise.html )
A straightforward argument for startups that might care about the 'enterprise'. There's gold in them there budgets! "Your payday will come much sooner and more predictably if you focus on fixing one of the infinite problems that businesses have."

The Raspberry Pi WebIDE. [Thanks to Ben Woodhams.]

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers#cost (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Object_Headers#cost )
Micropayments. We're not there yet. "This is the cost of access of a copyright work, with a specification of the payment system accepted." Not quite sure who wrote this 1992 spec: "Club Med I believe uses cloured beads."

http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/ (http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/ )
I'm amazed. Just amazed. Who would have thought that irritating carousels were ... irritating? "Auto-forwarding causes many usability problems ... users automatically assume that it might be an advertisement ..." - but I'm still trying to come to terms with Jakob Nielsen after his makeover.

Sold out, obviously. The excellent Tracy Thorn at Foyles. Might get returns, I suppose. [Thanks to Mark O'Neill.] ...

https://www.newwritingsouth.com/events?item=70 (https://www.newwritingsouth.com/events?item=70 )
... but there are still 88 tickets to see Tracy down in Brighton on 13th February, at the time of typing.

Joseph Burgo's examination of Lance Amstrong drifts a little towards pop-psych: "If he's going to learn and genuinely recover from this experience, Armstrong needs to feel authentic guilt for the hurt he inflicted on so many people."

Onwards!
