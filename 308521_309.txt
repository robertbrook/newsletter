That last Guess-Who was Horatio Bottomley. His paper: The Financial Times.

Here's another Guess-Who. Betjeman wrote to him: "you have a turn of phrase that is equal to that of Thomas Gray and Gibbon"; described as "a combination of Simon Cowell and Anne Robinson"; called the British Empire "evil" on live TV; died in 1960 "on the steps of Broadcasting House" - shortly after an interview with him had aired in which he broke down in tears after being questioned about his relationship with his mother; two thousand attended his memorial at Westminster Cathedral; his wax double at Madam Tussaud's was melted down three years after his death.

"For several months, visitors to Michael Stipe's house ... were given a choice of 'Swagger' or Bulgarian folk music. According to Peter Buck, 'Swagger' got played 'a lot'."

Evelyn King writes on Luke Hansard in the Spectator on the bicentenary of Hansard's birth, 1952: his mum wanted him to work in a pharmacy, but his Latin wasn't up to scratch.

Pret has a coconut problem. The coconut in the coconut, strawberry and chocolate thing is just bland. Not coconutty enough. Also, their coconut drink is similarly not coconutty enough.

"Gitifier is an application that runs in your MacOSX menu bar and monitors Git repositories that you're interested in. When someone pushes a new commit, it shows you a Growl notification." Tried it. Works.

Nick Asbury of Creative Review, on the recent Apple ads: "The copy is dire. Vacuous, boring, self-regarding and counter-productive. It starts with a glimmer of promise – the point about designing things with the user in mind – but then goes precisely nowhere with it. Arguably the worst thing is that it's entirely free of information." I agree.
