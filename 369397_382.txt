Henry Perky, the inventor of shredded wheat also holds patents including 'Design for a cereal cup', which seems very much like a open-ended cylinder in shredded wheat form; a coffee-roaster; a sort of shredded wheat wafer; an ornamented stove; a 'Machine for Preparing Food' and a 'Machine for manufacturing different varieties of cereals into unitary compound forms.'

I looked at something on the internet. Now I shall look at something else.

I'm considering moving to the new shiny Mailchimp editor, with images and everything. This would mean that the plain-text version would be automated, rather than me checking it by eye. I'm going to give it a go and hope it doesn't break things. Please could you drop me a line if it's unreadable? Or, of course, you could just unsubscribe. That would be okay too.
