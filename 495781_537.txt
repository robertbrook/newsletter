"One important question concerns whether appetite for work actually diminishes as people earn more. There are countervailing effects. On the one hand, a higher wage raises the opportunity cost of leisure time and should lead people to work more. On the other hand, a higher income should lead a worker to consume more of the stuff he or she enjoys, which presumably includes leisure."

I think I might be doing a poor job at book reviews. Ho hum.

"Agnes was imprisoned in a brothel as punishment for refusing to marry Procopius, ... She subsequently restored Procopius to life when he was strangled by a demon. Although he was repentant, Agnes was not spared her fate, and was condemned to burn. However, the flames had no effect on her, and she had to be killed with a spear."

"bro pages are a highly readable supplement to man pages. bro pages show concise, common-case examples for Unix commands." I don't like the name.
