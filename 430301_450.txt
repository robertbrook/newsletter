"Be thee luef, be thee loth, Sire Edward,
Thou shalt ride sporeles o thy liar
All the righte way to Dovereward—
Shalt thou nevermore breke foreward,
And that reweth sore.

Richard, thah thou be ever trichard,
Tricchen shalt thou nevermore.

Edward, thou dudest ase a shreward,
Forsoke thine eme’s lore."

"She lived through and wrote of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Moscow famine that followed it. In an attempt to save her daughter Irina from starvation, she placed her in a state orphanage in 1919, where she died of hunger." ... "Her husband Sergei Efron and her daughter Ariadna ... were arrested on espionage charges in 1941; and her husband was executed. Tsvetaeva committed suicide in 1941." ...

Thilo Ernst on Arno Schmidt: "an ideal novel should be as close as possible a textual simulation of memories / the human memory cannot and does not capture the entire stream of consciousness; instead, a series of 'snapshots' with accompanying associations is stored / therefore a (textual) 'photo album' should be the optimal narrative form."

Kamila Grzedzinska reviews 'The Nagra MSA (Mosfet Stereo Amplifier)': "To keep the MSA footprint size the same as other Nagra products the heatsink, which is machined from one solid piece of aluminium, is positioned on the top of the amplifier."

"Milling is one minute of controlled aggression, similar to boxing, but with a few important differences. There is no ducking, no weaving, and no fancy footwork. Just taking hits and dishing them out. The whole event was a bit of a blur. My competitor put up a great fight but I was lucky enough to get the decision. The minute seems more like an hour, when you’re fighting at that intensity and it was absolutely exhausting and there’s a lot of bloody noses and faces."
