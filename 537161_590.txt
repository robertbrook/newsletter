Vol. 2, No. 590. "A SORT OF GALLERY".
The photo is of part of the recycling plant by Battersea Power Station. At least, I think that's what it is.

I used to read this, years ago, when most of the content on the net was in American. Now, of course, we have home-grown. Here's a report on SIGGRAPH in LA: everything's too expensive and taking photos of people from satellites is weird. Also, they call Pathfinder - a site I used to work on - "swine".

Isabella Blow: "I've done the most peculiar jobs, ... I was working in a scone shop for years, selling apricot-studded scones. I was a cleaner in London for two years. I wore a handkerchief with knots on the side, and my cousin saw me in the post office and said, 'What are you doing?' I said, 'What do you think I look like I'm doing? I'm a cleaner!'" - I miss her, very much.

Nelson Mandela's tribute to Walter Sisulu, May 2003: "In a sense I feel cheated by Walter. If there be another life beyond this physical world I would have loved to be there first so that I would welcome him. ... I shall miss his friendship and counsel. Till we meet again, Hamba Kahle, Xhamela. Qhawe la ma Qhawe!"

"One evening I was told to sell ice cream and the picture that night was a desert one, Lawrence Of Arabia or something like that. I didn't really know what to do so I just went up to people and said 'Do you want an ice cream?' Of course, on the screen there were miles of sand and nothing but blazing heat. I think we broke the record on ice cream sales that night."

It's too late, really, for anything else.

"Disaster strikes – engine stops and won’t re-start - fuel leak. Manage to manoeuvre out of shipping channel to anchor in river behind two shrimp boats. Chris fixes leak and bleeds engine. While tightening bleed screw on injector pump, it sheers off - sickening feeling and very bad news ..."
