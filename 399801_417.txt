My dad still has something on his computer that mimics the old stickies that used to come with the Mac. Giles uses Geektool and a text file: "Now I have a text file called "thinkabout.txt", and its contents is always visible in the top-left corner of my desktop. It's not a todo list - I have one of those, and I use it differently. It's not a calendar, it doesn't proactively remind me to do stuff. I can edit the file and close it, and don't need to remember to keep checking it, because it's always there on my desktop." ...

... and much as there is to fret about with Squarespace, they certainly cover a lot. Here's how to upload and link to files. Honestly, for a lot of people, they're the least worst option.

I was thinking about sobriety. I don't drink, or smoke, or ... most other things. Those are the worst people, aren't they? If you can see someone's addictions, there's a straightforwardness to them. I can't claim that. Am I sober? In a way, yes.

"In 2003, a short-lived bourbon Crunchie was launched in test markets across the Nashville, TN area in partnership with 7-Eleven. The bourbon Crunchie was not well received because of a boycott initiated by western factions of the Southern Baptist Coalition and production was subsequently discontinued."

I was going to link to a story about a thing from a website but it had one of those ridiculous on-click popups telling me not to cut and paste.

Onwards.
