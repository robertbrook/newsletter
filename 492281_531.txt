531 - PATTERN - on the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)

Hello!

The web seems a mess right now. Messes aren't always bad, of course, but the flurry of activity around 'experience design', fragmentation and acceleration of certain technologies makes it a particularly fraught time.

That you have to go to these lengths in another indication of ... well, something.

Of course I have views and opinions about the place I work - and about how that place stores and publishes information. However, I am not employed to make those decisions, nor do I feel content expressing my own views when people who bear far more responsibility than I do are available to comment. It's not my job. It's their job. If you want my personal views, you can always ask. I'm quite prepared to share them privately. I'm almost certain that's still allowed.

Again, a flurry of Perl and - well, maybe I'll use this later. For something else.
