The rather vaguely pitched Brompton Urban Challenge: "In the urban jungle of the UK capital, teams of Brompton owners will ride around the city completing some Brompton-based challenges ..." - 19th May. I'm sure it'll be great.

I often hear myself saying things I've said before. I repeat myself a lot - and that's the times I notice at all. I do try to avoid saying things which are actually stupid, or things I realise are stupid. Of course, this doesn't stop me saying things which most other people think are stupid.

"I do no search for things using a British search engine, I do not post pics using a British tool, and I do not Tweet with a British Tweeting platform. There is a reason for that."

I used to think that I was more sure of things when I was younger - and less sure now. It seems more likely that I simply didn't realise how much of the world I couldn't even see.

"Why anyone anywhere would hire a British manager with their confrontational, ignorant, change for change's sake attitude is beyond me."

I think I might have cut myself in a few places. Not, you know, on purpose. Unwitting paper cuts, I imagine. To say I have cut myself shaving would be a shallow understatement. I have been using, or trying to use, something called the shavette - which sounds like something marketed to people who wish to remove hair from their slender legs. I do not have slender legs, nor do I wish to remove hair from them.

Scotty is to Haskell as Sinatra is to Ruby. "As for the name: Sinatra + Warp = Scotty." ...

Is it important that you have fun when making things? Does it matter that someone enjoyed making the thing you like?

Blanking, more and more. It's drained away.

Still, all you have to do is carve the block. And what a lot of block!

When I was 13 I stopped caring about Christmas. At 41 I think I've stopped caring about birthdays. Mine, I mean.

Which was all a roundabout way of saying that I do sometimes quote and point to stuff here that I don't agree with. It just catches my eye.

I should get out of the code business. It's a young person's occupation. But what can I do next?
