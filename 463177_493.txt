"We want to be able to add new features that would exceed the scope of IMAP. Further, the current mail stack was just not built for a good mobile experience, and it's complexity provides a considerable barrier for emerging mobile clients. We want to cut off the legacy baggage and keep the entry barrier for users and developers as low as possible." IMAP is "legacy baggage" already?

Chipped away at mail. Enough for now. I need a rest.

I think I'm finally at the stage where I love things that people make with code more than I love the web.

... "The Green is a mystical realm inhabited by the minds of all members of the Parliament of Trees. It also connects all forms of botanical life on earth. It is in the same category as The Red (which is connected to all animal life and run by the Parliament of Limbs), The Clear (which is associated with aquatic life), The Grey (which is connected to all fungal life), and The Black (which is associated with Death, was also called The Rot, and run by the Parliament of Decay)."

"Bodies, projected in our air, suffer no resistance but from the air. Withdraw the air, as is done in Mr. Boyleâ€˜s vacuum, and the resistance ceases. For in this void a bit of fine down and a piece of solid gold descend with equal velocity."

Stephen Fry: "Without Wodehouse I am not sure that I would be a tenth of what I am today - whatever that may be. In my teenage years, his writings awoke me to the possibilities of language. His rhythms, tropes, tricks and mannerisms are deep within me. But more than that, he taught me something about good nature. It is enough to be benign, to be gentle, to be funny, to be kind."
