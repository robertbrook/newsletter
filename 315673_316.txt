"Count Dante and the Black Dragon Fighting Society ... He was born in Chicago and after spending several years training in other arts, studied Shuri-ryu karate under American karate pioneer Robert Trias. After a distinguished early career, Danté became known as a 'black sheep' among martial artists, advocating a style he called Kata Dan-Te, which incorporated disfiguring and deadly techniques." Excellent stuff.

Moving from Google to not-Google. "I don’t have any aversion to using Google products in general and will still use them where they don’t require me to be entirely dependant on them ..., but where I require reliability, or where the service requires that I use it to store my content ..., I’ll look elsewhere from now on."

I like seeing what people write in the Apple App Store. Not the users, the developers. Have a look at the App Store page for Keyboard Maestro: it boils down to "Apple won't let us do what we want with an App Store app, so you should download the latest version from our web site" - which is fine, but how long will that last?

Honestly, Keyboard Maestro might do a little more than QuicKeys - and might be a little more stable - but the design of QuicKeys is much better. Maestro might have been rebooted in version 6, but it still looks dated.
