Morning all.

Episode 2 of 'Try Doorbell', a podcast with Lloyd Davis and me. Or, I.

I should drink this tea.

I love the planform of the Saab Draken. Are there any in the UK?

Scrolling iframes. Who does that. Animals.

Recommended by a friend, "The Silent Age", a game for iOS. This is the blog of the developers, 'House on Fire' - founded by Linda Randazzo, Uni Dahl and Thomas Ryder.

It's time to read.

Reminded by Liz Conlan of this: "MATTER has been acquired by Medium."

A relative suggests "You could try a Poirot moustache for Movember." - no thanks.

"Three of the five cyclists killed recently in London died on or near Cycle Superhighway 2, a cycle-path route running from Aldgate in the City to Stratford in the east of the capital. Rigged with a camera mounted on his helmet and another on his bike, Peter Walker rides the route." And people still wonder why I don't cycle in and out of work.

I do have more applicable "muscle memory" in emacs than in vim, notably.

"Stalinâ€™s Story", by Victor Gijsbers - thanks to @marxculture. "Everybody is on their toes. In these times of crisis, it is only too easy to displease Stalin. And if you displease Stalin, bad things happen to you."

Thanks to Mark Charmer for talking to me about 'short stack' systems. Now I need to go away and think about that a lot more.

Until 19th January next year - 'Masterpieces of Chinese Painting': "Explore over 100 of the finest examples of Chinese painting, from small-scale intimate works by monks and literati through to scroll paintings over 14 metres long, many of which have never before been seen in the UK." People still make websites with light text on dark backgrounds, then.

I want everything to be better.

I didn't like reading that. I won't link to it.

"We all wear a lot of hats ..." - hmm. I'm not wearing a hat.

Enjoy today.
