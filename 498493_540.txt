"As you can imagine, it is really bad news for a pianist when he gets diagnosed with a broken thumb."

I've only just noticed that apps in Apple's App Store are age rated.

"A design focused front-end web template using SASS, Jekyll and Grunt." A pity it seems to require Rails installed.

Parse OPML using Javascript, output via an embedded template. Lovely ...
