"Practically every record bearing the names Gerald Sims and Carl Davis are worth hearing; these two had a knack for this sort of thing which created some of the most sublime music ever cut to wax." - a writeup of Billy Bulter's "Right Track", from 1966.

The Albert Memorial has scaffolding crawling up it.

For four and a half hours, people were stuck on the fairground wheel at Earls Court, in May 1896. Presumably the two steam engines driving it fell over. This incident was so famous that a song was written about the compensation offered for passengers: "I've Got The Five Pound Note". A publication called 'The Builder', which I've often found to be somewhat caustic, suggested that "We have as little sympathy with this foolish kind of sensational toy as we have with Eiffel towers â€¦ It is only a pity that all the ability and cost expended in its construction should not be devoted to some more useful end than carrying coach-loads of fools round a vertical circle."

Oxford Street's an odd place.

At Monmouth. Someone half my age is recruiting an intern for their Facebook marketing company. A company with two hundred employees. It's another world, obviously.

"... being an R stock she took off and before I dropped the handle I'd given the unit such a bash that I'd knocked it past the end of the underbridge and the shunter was knocked onto his arse. Not only that but I damaged the coupler somehow and it stopped half-cocked when I pushed the couple button. Then no matter what we did we just could not get that engine to turn back again. So there we were mechanically coupled and not able to go any further. The names I got called for that would have painted the sky blue. The upshot of this was that the Wimbledon branch was shut down for 90 odd minutes while the heavy gang came down to try and put things right. Which in the end they did."

Interning is an odd thing. Is it still what was called work experience, or being an apprentice? I spent years sweeping floors - but it that a useful thing for people to do?

Have a lovely day today, if you can.
