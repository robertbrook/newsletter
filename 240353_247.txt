Thinking about artificial scarcity. And balloon-squeezing. But not balloon-modelling.

It is spring yet? Or summer? I'm not sure. I suppose it must be. One of those. The heaters are back on in the buses - though apparently they're not heaters, more heat dissipators. They're not there to heat up the passengers, they're there to cool down the bus.

Does anyone know where I could get a slide rule? Other than ebay?

Still confused about Drafts. Simperium isn't doing it for me.

I cracked a tooth again. This seems to happen a lot. Well, only when I eat gravel. Or, after forty, whenever I eat anything other than yoghurt. Gravel is becoming an expensive habit. I bet it happened overnight, though. In the middle of some troubling dream. Oh, the dreams.

"This time with attachment." Rewind, my selector!

Massive hooter.

My goodness - the bags under my eyes! What's happening to me? Don't answer that.

I uninstalled Google Plus Now whatever. But not before I'd checked it out and half-formed an opinion about it: "Dabbling in Google Now. Very interesting." I had a big thing about Now vs. Siri, but it's difficult to distil. Something about pull and push notifications. Noises that it'll probably kill Cue, previously Greplin. See, this should be a blog post.

Getting closer to that blog idea again. Newletter too, of course.
