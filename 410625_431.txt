Sure the only answer is mesh or peering? I asked someone about this more than a year back but never held on long enough to understand why that wasn't such a great idea.

"We've always eaten, learned, grown, fallen in love, fought, and died." - thanks to Dominic Tinley for that.

I'm finally going to admit something here. I'm a bather. A bath-taker. There, I've said it.
