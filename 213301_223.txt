Lime marmalade from Dan Lepard. Looks lovely, but I can't imagine staying awake long enough to make it.

"People like to knock notch as a terrible developer, he probably is, but I don't know if having amazing developers is necessarily the key to having a successful game. I think Notch's strong suit is he has good taste."

I have mixed feelings about this.

"I publish under a Pseudonym, and I do this so I can take short-cuts, iterate, and publish rubbish to build up to my magnum opus. I'm also going to start painting under this Pseudonym, so I can ship painting."

Still failing to link node. Plodding through Google suggestions. Aha! Breakthrough!

"In 1929, Olave Lady Baden-Powell, was asked to ascertain from the Founder what gift he would like to celebrate the twenty-first birthday of Scouting.  He replied, 'A pair of braces'. Scouts around the world were asked to donate a penny per member and sufficient was raised to buy a custom built Rolls-Royce car (Jam Roll), a caravan (Eccles), a portrait by David Jaggar and the sought after pair of braces."

"Though [Caroline] Achaintre’s process is highly technical and labour-intensive, she develops her work quite spontaneously. Because she has to tuft the wool from the back side of the canvas, her compositions are developed largely through intuition."

"I was in despair. Deep despair. I drew myself: the representative of an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya’s peasant before the firing squad. I formalised the drawing into a line and put a circle round it." ...
