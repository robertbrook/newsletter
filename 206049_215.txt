"Most typically, they're imitating the sort of clucky North London accent characteristic of Adele's speaking voice, and they do so frequently at a volume that can charitably be described as 'demonstrable.'"

"JSDB is a collection of the best javascript libraries" - still amazed by all this stuff.

Why do you think you have failed? Why do you, you, think you failed? Why do you think that you've failed? Like many things, it may be more important to ask someone else if you really have.

After a recent edition of 'Roderick On The Line', I'm thinking more about the benefit of argument as discovery and a method of interacting. I don't mean argument as in derision or combat, but as in exposition and examination. A sort of scientific method.

I recognised the banner image at the top of a weird Internet forum recently. I'm getting old fast. It was from Transmetropolitan, which I have rather a soft spot for now.

Thanks to Giles Turnbull for pointing me to DJ Derek - I'm even further out the loop than you are, Giles. A great documentary on a fascinating man. Do check out part two as well.

Also via Giles, Pollen's music, from Bristol. When I'm finally released, I think I might like to move to Bristol. I loved the harbour especially.

Via @redmamba: "The real metric of business success is whether you have a positive impact — on your industry, on your community, on (in a small way) the world at large.

Via @marxculture: "... plastic medieval weaponry; assorted Lego (Space, Castle and Pirate); an inflatable Tyrannosaurus rex (punctured slowly into extinction); a Superman action figure (I lost it and hyperventilated with grief); a pair of cuddly rabbits (Sally and Billy); toy cars; a tiny guitar; a plane you launched with an elastic catapult; a replica pistol I thought my mum didn’t know about."

Listning to Soundcloud. Everything fades, folds in on itself, a tunnel. Everything is erased and without structure. Everything passes and is lost. Eventually, I am so tired that my eyes hurt, that I cannot see enough to move forward, that time shortens before me and the world rushes into a point; that point which will absorb me, with everything.
