A very comprehensive review of the FT's web app from Wilson Page: the whole thing seems rather adventurous. I'm glad people are doing this and experimenting with what's possible in the browser - but I'm far more confident with old tech. "Our application was drastically reworked to make the new requirements possible, and this took a lot of time. Having made this investment, we hope the new application not only meets (and even exceeds) the standard of the first product, but gives us a platform on which we can develop faster and more flexibly in the future."

"The price of orange juice [is?] influenced by the following factors: The navel orange is the product of a single mutation that occurred in 1820. A monastery in Brazil discovered this seedless variety of orange and began to export cuttings to the U.S." #spoons

One of those coffee subscription outfits - but in London! In fact, just round the corner from where I used to live in Bermondsey. And under Â£7 for a quarter kilo. I should try these folks out.

Have a good day.
