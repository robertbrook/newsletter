443 - BLUES

On the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)

Good morning.

I missed this: "Join Patrick Keiller and Mark Fisher for a screening of Quatermass 2 followed by a discussion prompted by the film and by the histories explored in Keiller's films ..."

Everyone is younger than me. They all have smaller screens to look at. I look like an old geezer with this iPad Mini. Yes, I have the visual accessibility settings on. You can't judge me!

Matthew Flatt proposes a better mouse-trap: "Some programming languages include constructs - such as overloading or laziness - that a clever programmer can exploit to encode a domain-specific language. The design of Racket addresses the problem more directly; it gives programmers tools to explicitly extend the programming language with new syntax."

Does Rebol 3 have a GUI toolkit yet? I mean a built-in one, not a tacked-on one?

Peter Kirn on Cristian Vogel: "Strap in for an amusement park journey through what seems to be every avant-garde trace imaginable." Vogel lives!

Us old people have nothing to network for. Chap in suit and tie looks distinctly un-relaxed. I supposed I must do as well. I think he's checking his email.

Oh dear. I think I might have sat behind a tall person.

"StatHat makes detailed time series charts of your stats. It shows you an overview of your stats allowing you to quickly scan all of them."

A lovely place in Kent, nearest station Minster, possibly. Yours for Â£410k, freehold. "The east Kent area is becoming increasingly renowned for its wide variety of cultural activities and outstanding food outlets and restaurants." Hmm. I could retire.

I don't think "harass people into doing things better" is really a job description. Maybe I should change that from "harass" to "harangue".

Bit of a down-side to writing on this screen: no word-count. Let's see how that goes.

I'm sitting tucked in the top left of a new Routemaster, listening to Vivian Stanshall. Nice chap.

This is obviously where St. Paul landed. Speaking of which - saints in spaceships!

I think I might start wearing a nice hat.

Enjoy today.
