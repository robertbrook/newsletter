I'm testing a slightly simpler layout. Please let me know at mail@robertbrook.com if it's unreadable.

Good morrow.
Why call me 'Robert' in one email and 'Rob' in another? It really is Robert, by the way.

'Tiny delights' in an operating system? "Using the FaceTime camera to add signatures to PDFs in Preview", "make a new folder with a selection of files" - this one is fantastic, though how anyone can think that "Mail.app is full of smiles and neat animations" I really don't know ...
