Good morning everyone.

R J M Carr asks 'Must we still despise the sixties?' - "The current dislike of the buildings and structures of the last fifty years, especially prevalent in industrial archaeological circles, can be likened to that of artistically inclined mid-Victorians for whom a bogus mythical medieval past was far preferable to the immense technological achievements of their own time. This seems to be a peculiarly English trait, as is the disdain for engineers."

The new design of this newsletter - well, slightly tweaked at least - seems to be going okay so far.

Simon Usborne: "Now Audrey Hepburn has become the latest face to be disinterred for promotional purposes, returning to the screen 20 years after her death to advertise a chocolate bar." ...

... "A model of Audrey was built using the iconic star’s film catalog and press photographs. A new renderer called ‘Arnold,’ designed to accurately simulate the tracing of light, enabled the team to perfect the soft, translucent feel of real skin. The biggest challenges for Framestore were Audrey’s eyes and signature smile. A team of four animators hand-animated carefully posed expressions in every shot in order to bring the star to life."

"Calverts was set up after an industrial dispute at IRAT services, the design and publishing wing of the Institute for Research in Art and Technology. The workers had been told that they were working for a ‘co-operative’, which turned out not to be the case when they found themselves in dispute over a sacking, and then all of them facing redundancy notices."

Justine Larbalestier reviews 'A Space of Her Own: Pamela Zoline’s “The Heat Death of the Universe” by Mary E. Papke' - "Zoline’s work shows clear affinities with the avant-grade and frequently confrontational extrapolative fiction appearing at the time" ... "Not surprisingly, many conservative critics of science fiction dismiss such new wave writing for what they see as its too facile, manipulative but inconsequential gestures toward science and, so, bracket it off as not science fiction."

Have a good day, if you can.
