Isaac Asimov, writing in 1964, imagining our next year - 2014: "men will continue to withdraw from nature in order to create an environment that will suit them better"; "Robots will neither be common nor very good"; nuclear power; solar power; "transportation that makes the least possible contact with the surface" - ground-effect planes; "roboticized cars"; "moving sidewalks"; "moon colonies"; ... "Underwater housing will have its attractions to those who like water sports".

Please never use the word "excellence" in my hearing.
