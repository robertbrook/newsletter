Until the middle of March next year: 'Only in England: Photographs by Tony Ray-Jones and Martin Parr' - "Fascinated by the eccentricities of English social customs, Tony Ray-Jones spent the latter half of the 1960s travelling across England, photographing what he saw as a disappearing way of life."
