A presentation on 'Cloud Hosting for PostgreSQL'. "Does your database use actually fit EC2's business and cost model?" - followed by a mix of war stories and terrifying anecdotes. A great read.

I assume Howard Jones is still alive? If only there was some way to Google that.

When it runs, it runs. When it doesn't, that's terrible, but that's how it is for a while.
