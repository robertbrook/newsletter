PS4 - and the next XBox - will presumably signal a shift cloud-wards.

Github's Mac provisioning toolset, wrapping homebrew and more. Does this make any sense for individual users?

Gentlemen! May I take this opportunity to recommend - no, wait, that's not right. Shavers! May I take this opportunity to recommend 'Echo of Bloomsbury', a hair salon at 49b, Museum Street. Here you may find 'Proraso' shaving products, for a very good price. A nice Lebanese man will serve you and tell you about his shaving brush and stand, made from the hairs of a "special animal", which I took to mean a badger. I've not had my hair cut their though.

Gentlemen who have their hair cut! Let me take this opportunity to recommend Pall Mall Barbers, just up from Trafalgar Square. This is where I have my bonce shaved regularly after the work outfit prices stretched to the incredible. I have no complaints. In fact, they are a delight.

I was a big Detroit techno fan. I suppose I still am. Here's an article by Andy Thomas, on "The myths and messages of Detroit techno" - "In truth, techno’s futuristic path probably began somewhere between Düsseldorf and
Detroit." I miss the clubs. I miss a lot of things. "... improvisation is more or less tied to an impoverished community that has had to find new ways of entertainment and new ways of survival."

I think Roger McGough needs new glasses. And a haircut. A makeover.

Sometimes I miss Twitter. Most of the time I don't. Not because it's somehow bad, but because it's gone beyond me.

But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out."

Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, Robert Zubek - "MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research" [PDF] - "The difference between games and other entertainment products (such as books, music, movies and plays) is that their consumption is relatively unpredictable. The string of events that occur during gameplay and the outcome of those events are unknown at the time the product is finished."
