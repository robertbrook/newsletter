... his niece Stacey writes: "I was sixteen the first time I came to 18 Folgate Street, traveling alone without my parents.  I was unprepared for 18th century life.  I fell down the stairs, cut my thumb slicing bread, stumbled around by candlelight, and I couldn’t light a fire to save my life.  Dennis didn’t have a bath in those early days, so in between trips to the neighbor’s to wash, I was covered in soot."

Bryan Appleyard: "This year more than ever, with a war on and with the end of the excessive confidence of the long consumer boom in the West, we want Christmas to be about the past.

"Jim showed me the missing finger on his left hand, sliced off while cutting a mitre from left to right, a mark that today he regards as the proud badge of his carpenter’s trade." What an extraordinary man.

Vera Rule, in 2001: "True confession: in the flat in which I squat, some of the many dusty bookstacks are composed entirely of house books ..."

"When I first knew Dennis Severs in the 1970s, he was carting tourists ‘round West London in a decrepit, 100-year-old horsedrawn landau. Later, I sold him a house in then-slummy (now chic) inner-London Spitalfields, where he soon adopted a lifestyle no different from that of the Huguenot family he claimed had built the place in 1724."

Terribly tired. Everything slipping away. Dissolving.
