Spotlight is running fine on this machine, as far as I can tell, but takes some time to become responsive after a restart. Is there anything I might be able to do about that?

"Certain it is that the eye masculine will follow with pleasure, and perhaps with some emotion, the movements of the young girl who comes out bright and fresh, gives her horse a pat or two, with a lump of sugar, as she glances him quickly over, looks kindly at her stable-boy, and then skips gayly into the saddle from a chair brought out by a maid, while the same eye will rest quite unmoved, except by a spirit of criticism, on the self-conscious and selfish damsel, though she be put on in the most approved manner by the smartest groom who ever wore top-boots." - from Horsemanship for Women, by Theodore Hoe Mead

"... the members of the [Rolling Stones] all shared in a company in the UK called Nanker Phelge Music. After signing a deal in New York which would channel all their material through another company called Nanker Phelge USA, and assuming that it was the same company but with an American name, the Stones soon realised that then co-manager Allen Klein owned the American version in its entirety. This led to a legal battle that would stretch over seventeen years."

Via John Keogh - "Novelist Brian Aldiss discusses his final science fiction work Finches Of Mars, which he's published at the age of 87. He also reveals why he has been writing a short story every day for the last year and casts his mind back over a long career that included a brief stint as an erotic novelist."
