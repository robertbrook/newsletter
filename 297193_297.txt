I think I need to throw lots of stuff out again.

Why would you want to pay for a personal email account? When it comes with FTP and WebDAV.

"...  it will be possible for a business man in New York to dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in the existing equipment." Nikola Tesla, 1908. I suppose the only bit he got wrong was the desk.

I am trying out a new Mac desktop mail application called Airmail. It freezes less frequently that Apple Mail and also feels faster. So far. Some of the design decisions seem a little questionable, though.

I think it's time for a cup of tea.

I went for a very rapid visit to Brighton and the museum. A couple of things: skip the Jeff Koons and make sure to visit another part of the museum, 'Women Artists in the Fine Art collection'. It's one of the very best exhibitions I've ever seen. "Paintings and drawings from the 18th century to the late 20th century by artists such as Angelica Kauffman and Mary Beale are shown alongside modern works by Thérèse Lessore, Sylvia Gosse, Vanessa Bell, Hilda Carline, Dod Procter, and Gillian Ayres." I may well just go back again. You should go.

If iOS7 is a shonky as Gruber and Sandy seem to hint at, I might give up on mobile and retreat to the desktop for a year or so. In fact, that already sounds like an idea I might get into. It would be a relief, in a way.

That Gillian Ayres painting in the Brighton Museum was 'Sappho'. It sold in 1990 for £8,000.

That is one noisy zoom. Thank goodness we've moved beyond that.

The Dod Proctor painting in Brighton was 'Morning' - I think. She died the same year I was born. That particular painting was "was voted Picture of the Year at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1927 and bought for the nation by the Daily Mail newspaper".

Have a good day.
