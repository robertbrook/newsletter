Why do .in domains seems to be cheaper than many other geos?

Sorry about the spelling errors that crop up now and then. They're the combined result of inattention, tiredness and autocorrect.

So far I'm enjoying reading "Against Method" again. Though it was recommended to me by someone I could never really understand, though I did trust them enough to buy the book. Was it a sort of prodding? Did they believe Feyerabend? Does it matter what the person recommending that I read the book thought of the book? For some reason it still stays with me. What did they think?

I'm used to books being firmly in one or other camp. "Against Method" isn't - or, not enough in my limited reading at least. I'd be much more at home with Feyerabend's erstwhile sparring partner, Imre Lakatos. Not at home with what he wrote, necessarily, but how he wrote it.

I have ear-ache. In the left ear.

I'm more convinced that science as method is being mimicked than come-away-from. Though, of course, that as well, but less so.

Over-simply put, scientists are people too. My dentist eats biscuits. Doctors, even, smoke.

This claim of completeness is all around us. Well, a sizeable portion of us. Wherever you see doubt, fall upon it and protect it! Completeness is only death.

It should be easy, though, to divide things into those which are the case and those which are not, shouldn't it? Though I'm off the rails here, of course. Feyerabend isn't doubting facts, only the methods we use to produce them.

But maybe Feyerabend is wrong in seeing science as a whole in itself, with singular claims? Isn't a real scientific method one which always moves from proof, to refutation, to proof again? Is his view of science naive, or a straw-man?

Already I partly agree with his argument, partly disagree because of the way he makes it. My problem, of course. But how does all this help? Or am I thinking wishfully?

And what's so wrong with 'local method' and 'local fact'? Can't we have localised science: things which are good enough for here and now, without joining some unified theory?

Anyway, I'm enjoying the book. And now I think I should make some cocoa.
