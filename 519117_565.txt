565 - DARWIN'S GREENHOUSE - on the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)
I got on a train and it went really fast, really fast. I got a bit frightened. Why? Creeping through Northampton. I can't remember if I've ever been here before.

There's someone on the bus from the Bolivian Air Force. #battersea

"What you have here is a rudimentary persistent cache."

This evening is that IndieWeb meetup. I'm already nervous.

"Vegetarians, we say, are self-righteous and humourless; or fussy and weird; or like Hitler; we say that their diet makes them anaemic; ... [But thankfully] 'Farmageddon' is a curiously consoling book for a British meat-eater because, once you’ve waded through all the horror, you can think, at least I haven’t forced any tribespeople off their land lately and thank God I’m not buying my chickens in Taiwan." #godwin #lately

I don't have much in common with anyone. A final realisation.

"Earn trust, earn trust, earn trust." A bit more of an issue where you're in an environment where it's rule by job title. For example. You don't have to have people trust you if you're just 'in charge' and what you say goes unchallenged.

Blasted lamp keeps flickering. Hm. It just went out completely.

Tim Bray's site still runs on his own Perl code: "But hey, it’s mine; an old friend now, flaws and all, and there are lessons there; not that I have any urge to share it.

Have fun today.
