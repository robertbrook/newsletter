TimBL states the obvious, obviously: if you don't have root on your device, it's not your device. Okay, sure, fine: but how do I explain this to my mum? Does she have to care about this? As long as she's not looking for a general-purpose computer, who cares, right?

"Why [Stack Exchange] believe in letting people work full-time from home": "It lets you hire good people who can’t move ... You don’t lose people to silly things like their significant other going to medical school ... When done right, it makes people extremely productive ... It makes you focus on more than butts in chairs." I'm most interested in the extremely productive bit. In fact, I'd settle for just productive. And not irritated. That would be great.

Project Dark Gene: "It is presumed that Capt. Gennady Eliseev then made a conscious decision to ram the RF-4C to prevent it escaping, as the MiG-21 aircraft rammed the aircraft from the left and below, near the engine nozzles, probably cutting off the tail of the RF-4C, throwing it into a high-speed dive." Project Ibex: "a joint CIA+NSA / Iran enterprise for building and operating a series of observation and listening posts along the Soviet border"
