"While good for simple effects, popular JavaScript libraries like jQuery lack the Oomph required to animate complex user interactions in the DOM. JSTween was designed from the ground up for speed and precision ..."

Chris Coyier on using "!important" in CSS: he argues it's good for making elements "robust" - together with the little-used in-browser style sheet.

Aspen, a python framework. "Aspen maps your URLs directly to the filesystem. Itâ€™s way simpler than regular expression routing or object traversal." Hm. I like that.

Books on JavaScript available free on the web. Non-horrible ones, by the look of it. Actually this looks great. I should squash all these into Devonthink.

"Like dogs, kids can tell very accurately whether or not someone wishes them well." Also: "I would guess a smart person can learn to hack sufficiently well in 6 months to a year." Let's go through that last one. Paul Graham, that guy, thinks that it'll take up to a year - a year - for a smart person to learn to hack sufficiently well. So you have to be smart already, spend a year - and coming out, you'll be able to hack, sufficiently well.
