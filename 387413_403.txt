In which I continue to agree with Russell. "They could call that innovation if they want, but it's not, it's competence. It's the basics." I know I bang on about this pretty much continually - but if your organisation is newly into 'Rapid App Development', 'Innovation', 'R&D' and similar queasy euphemisms, you should get back to work.

It was because Herr Hitler had decided that the time was ripe for another step forward in his design to dominate Europe."
