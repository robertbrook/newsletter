Good morning.

"... if any person accustomed to drink wine would but try malt liquor for a month, he would find himself so much the better for it, that he would soon take to the one, and abandon the other. Some suppose the superior bottom of the British soldiery to be owing, in a great measure, to their use of malt liquor."

Tom Service: "This music is expressive: not in a conventionally emotional way, perhaps, but it has an ecstatic, cathartic power.

Have fun today.
