In which I try to write about how I'm not trying to write better and why and stuff.

"A feed fetching and parsing library" - still going strong. "This thing needs to hammer on many different feeds in the wild. I'm sure there will be bugs. I want to find them and crush them."

After those New Bus for Londons, a New Taxi for London. We can do better than this, can't we? Why all the wallowing in nostalgia? Surely there are some contemporary designs that don't have to be populist to be popular ...

I'm still planning on retiring the newsletter and the weekly post at the start of May this year: that's still about 112 newsletter and 16 weekly posts. You can unsubscribe now, if you'd like.

Have fun.
