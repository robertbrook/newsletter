"A web action is the interface and user experience of taking a specific discrete action, across the web, from one site to another site or application. They're not a specific technology but use a variety of technologies."

Let's just start saying 'URL' and 'HTML' again: "URI and IRI are just confusing. In practice a single algorithm is used for both so keeping them distinct is not helping anyone."

I'm reading William Golding's "Darkness Visible" - a great book, but hard work.

Barnaby Walters on how to add 'rel=me' links to a Squarespace site. I'm going to do that right now.

Axel Rauschmayer's book, "Speaking Javascript". It's available free in HTML ...

... "CoffeeScript does a great job at insulating programmers from many of JavaScript's bad parts, but it won't help enforce a consistent style across a code base. CoffeeLint can help with that."

I've been reading about mesolithic and neolithic history. Absolutely fascinating. Has anyone got any book recommendations?

I was with Textdrive from the beginning - and, yes, paid for stuff. Sad, this. I suppose I should bite the bullet and get set up at Linode ...

... are Linode doing their pay per use thing yet?

... Joshua Lederberg: "I was fascinated with the Dewey Decimal System, which was so helpful in locating books in the public library: if I could but memorize that, it would be proxy for mastery of all the knowledge it classsed."

Today I need to be quiet, to listen and to record. Please don't try to make me join in with the whole business theatre stuff: I have work to do.

Onwards.
