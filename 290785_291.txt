My new coffee cup. I like it. A lot.

Although I'm easily distressed, I do seem also to be easily cheered.

I don't mind having lots to do. In fact, I rather like it.

No greener grass anywhere: DC has terrible winters; SF "not a nice place for young children", smells;  London is "expensive" and "sucks".

A terrible result. A terrible thing to see.

One of my favourite Beach Boys songs is 'Free Flows', written a year before I was born. But I don't much like the guitar break or the flute noodling, which make up quite a chunk of the track. It's still great. Jack Rieley was one of the writers, along with Carl Wilson. Later, Jack Rieley worked with Mark Gardener of Ride.

Robert Christgau on the Beach Boys album 'Holland', which is as old as I am: "I admit that this sounds real good - it's engineered clear and bright as a redwood mountain stream - but to overlook what's doing the sounding is formalism as deliberate stupidity. That is, the actual music and words are murky and dim. I suppose that in time their tongue-tied travelogue of Big Sur may seem no more escapist than 'Fun Fun Fun', but who'll ever believe it's equally simple, direct, or innocent?" - I still like it, though not as much as 'Surfs Up'.

I'm going to start posting events on a calendar at Fading City. There's lots of stuff around that I can't always get to, but I'm sure others might be interested in.

"People have the right to cut themselves off from society, to live lives that are off the grid, but for those that are at risk there must be more resources to try to prevent unneeded suffering."

Have a lovely day. Perhaps it won't rain.
