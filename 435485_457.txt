James Gillray. Actually rather grisly.

Isn't this the theme to 'The Clothes Show'? Goodness, it's a bit pumped up.

"Touch ID is impressive technology, but it would be a shame if the only way to match the usability of the last six years of iOS was to turn it off."

I'm using Spotify to listen to stuff I don't usually listen to, rather than stay in nostalgia territory. I'm into 'chillwave', it seems. The Spotify recommendations seem pretty good, too.

As is always at this time of year, Kings Road is being dug up and the cell lines are going down. You can understand why people get like they do, can't you.

Multitouch. There's lots.

Jack Anderson's obituary of Alicia Markova, quoting Grace Roberts: "Markova's deerlike shyness ..., her tragic, controlled despair, the exquisite movement of her hand ..., all are unforgettable in their subtlety." ... "A tiny black-haired woman, Dame Alicia was just over 5 feet 2 inches tall, and during her dancing years she rarely weighed more than 98 pounds, even though she usually devoured a thick steak after performances."

"At the compound, named the 'Hidan of Maukbeiangjow', Ruthie is killed and replaced with a confused alien. This is supervised by the sorcerer Aph ..., who is a slave to an evil alien named Utaya ... Aph accidentally led Utaya to Earth. Another human looking alien ..., teaches the replacement Ruthie how to function in her new body. She also kidnaps Trowel so his body could to be used by Utaya."

"The film opens with 'credits painted on a wooden fence,' which I soon found to be the most popular opening credits style for ultra low-budget hicksploitation films, usually accompanied by banjo music or random sounds of pig squealing â€” sometimes both."

"This song is about an aspiring actress, with the director/photographer promising her a big break. Whether he's leading her on or not is unknown, and given where the band got its name, you can't help but wonder what kind of actress Peg is." Seems a bit harsh.

David Rodigan makes me love London. London makes me love David Rodigan.

Have fun.
