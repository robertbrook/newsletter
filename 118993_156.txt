"F.W. Woolworth and the American Five and Dime: A Social History" - "... the important role that Woolworth stores played in the sit-down strikes of the 1930s, the lunch counter sit-ins ... which tainted Woolworth's as the Big Business enemy of the downtrodden ... the closing of a Woolworth's in Germany by Nazi soldiers ..."

Meanwhile, back at the office: " ... the joke about SAP has always been, it’s making 50s German manufacturing methodology, implemented in 1960s software technology, delivered to 1970-style manufacturing organizations, like it’s really — yeah, the incumbency — they are still the lingering hangover from the dot-com crash." Ouch. That from Marc Andreessen. Also, he points to the skills gap.

"[Haskell] allows type constructors, classes, and type variables to be operators, and to be written infix, very much like expressions." Cool!

'Ni no Kuni' is a game available in Japan on the Nintendo DS, which won't be available in a translated version: "Level-5 gave up on localizing this due to difficulties they foresaw selling the game with its thick Magic Master book, as well as potential difficulties with translating the book in the first place. The PS3 version of the game uses a digital version of the book which players can call up from the menu."

London is bright and cold.
