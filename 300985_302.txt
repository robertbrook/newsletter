Mirjam Cvetič, Iñaki García-Etxebarria, James Halverson: "We discuss a number of issues arising when computing non-perturbative effects systematically across the string theory landscape. In particular, we cast the study of fairly generic physical properties into the language of computability/number theory and show that this amounts to solving systems of diophantine equations." #spoons

"Holding an infill plane lover's dream come true, the tool youth had to make sure his hands were free of Cheetos' dust, grease, dirt, ketchup and other grimy stuff that 12 year old boys cover themselves with before he was allowed to grip this spectacular pre-War dovetailed steel Norris A1 panel plane in its original box ..." - I love this writing.

"Many probability distributions are so important in theory or applications that they have been given specific names." - including 'Bernoulli', 'Rademacher', 'degenerate', 'discrete', 'Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric', 'skew normal', 'Dirac delta function', 'Wigner semicircle', 'Beta prime', 'folded normal', 'Gumbel distribution' ... how wonderful.

Have a lovely day.
