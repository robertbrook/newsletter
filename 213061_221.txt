Postgres 9.3: pretty much JSON native. Nice.

"... I didn’t write this post to scare people off working for themselves, I think it’s a wonderful thing to do and it gives you some wonderful opportunities but I think many of the posts and guides write with rose tinted glasses that it will all be fine as long as you work hard, working hard is great but that’s not the only factor."

"Of course, the environment we have here where people do make facetious answers is conducive to that sort of misunderstanding. I wish people wouldn't do that, because it makes the environment distrustful, and the risky answers that I like to give are unsafe in such a distrustful environment."

All about Blink: "We intend to distract people from this obvious problem by continually implying that our as-yet unwritten replacement is somehow much better and more sophisticated than the rendering engine that until yesterday was more than good enough to permit us to achieve total dominance of the Windows desktop browsing market in less than two years." Why would Google do this, if not to eat the market and dominate standards? And why shouldn't they?

Humility. I don't have it. I'm too angry, still. Exhausted and angry.

"The other day, we notice a terrible burning smell coming out of the server room." I narrowly escaped a Halon-filled server room once. No fire, just an alarm test with me still in the room.
