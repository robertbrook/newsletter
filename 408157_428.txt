I'm typing in a CAPTCHA! I haven't done that in years. It's still rubbish.

Is it coconut "juice" or coconut "milk"? Saying milk sounds weird. Saying juice sounds wrong. Coconade?

Anne Dudley on her theme to 'Jeeves and Wooster': "Attempting to avoid the obvious, Bertie Wooster has a minor key theme - albeit with many variations and permutations. My favourite variation was the English pastoral style that it acquired on a bright country morning as Jeeves serves breakfast in a cowshed." - a sublime quote of Vaughan Williams' "Lark Ascending", if I remember correctly.

"I kept as still as I could. Nothing happened. I did not expect anything to happen. I was something that lay under the sun and felt it, like the pumpkins, and I did not want to be anything more. I was entirely happy. Perhaps we feel like that when we die and become a part of something entire, whether it is sun and air, or goodness and knowledge. At any rate, that is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep." Willa Cather

The sound of glasses touching as they are carried.
