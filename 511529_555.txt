555 - OVER VAUXHALL - on the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)

At work: FileTransporter's 'Connected Desktop' won't launch. At home: ReadKit won't launch. Efficient!

I'm going to write something about what people call 'stress'.

I really have stopped even looking at Twitter now. It's no fun for me. I can't play with the bigger boys any more.

At "Milk No Sugar" in Brighton. A nice man is showing me how to make Vietnamese coffee. This place has space to sit, it's just down from the station, serves food, has wifi and a toilet. Amazing. I've had better coffee, but it was still pretty good. I bought a Vietnamese coffee filter - it looks like a small metal cup and saucer with a filter in it.

HTML::Miner is a bit like my brutal URL idea, but not quite there. I'm tending very much to writing it in Perl, though. A hammer and magic bullet combined.

I think I've got ReadKit back on it's feet again on this screen. Not sure how I can persuade FileTransporter to come alive, though. Hey, ReadKit? Are you still eating my CPU? Or, maybe not. Force quit. #beachballing
