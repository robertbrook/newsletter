I wrote something called "Across the square". It's a bit of a chunk, so I'll come back to Fading City in the week before Christmas. Anyway, I'm glad I wrote it. The writing is a bit clunky and thin in parts, but then I'm not a writer, so that's okay. I wanted to write about a strong feeling in an indirect way: this seemed good enough.

No, I don't draft or edit things. Obviously. I might correct some spelling, if I spot it, but that's it. I had my idea, I did my thing. There, done. Most people will never see it, a few people will like it and even fewer won't. I'll take that.

I realised that a few of my favourite writers pretty much write the same story, over and over again. The other things I want to do definitely feel like the same underlying story, told again. I'm not sure there's any point trying to avoid it.

Two thousand words is a very short short story. Next, something about an island, about three times the length. Maybe I could put it on Fading City over two months. That might be fun. There, yes: eight weeks of that would take me up to the middle of February, I think.

It's not really about an island. It's about a feeling, again, but written in an odder way. That's the plan. After that, something with characters. Depending on how up to speed my screen-typing is, that's going to take quite a long time, but might appear sometime next summer. If I've worked it out right. I'll have to keep up a fair old rate.

Why am I still awake?

Why am I still anything, come to think of it.

I deleted a really grumpy thing about job titles there. It doesn't matter. It's just me. I shouldn't get so distressed about things.

I should celebrate things, like I said I should.
