From TfL's 'Twitter policy': "In an emergency, dial 999." And - "If you follow us on Twitter we will not automatically follow you back. We have chosen to do this so that you can easily identify other key Twitter users that we think are relevant and useful in our Follow list, and not because we are being impolite or disrespectful."

It's not gone below ten degrees yet - and I already feel terribly tired and almost always cold. I can't think quite why, though every year seems a little worse. Perhaps I will be one of those people who retires to the south for the winter ...

... though I should like little better than to be put up in a tiny garconniere, in any second-tier city in any place in Europe where English is excused, in a dark-lit room, with a small fire I can feed through-out most days - and leave the place only when called to by some lighter errand, I shall wait without trepidation for the snow, even welcome it ...

... but I always come back to: how shall I pay the gas-bill?
