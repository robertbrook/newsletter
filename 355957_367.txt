I'm nervous about talking about money. So here's something about it from Jono Hey instead.

An American correspondent notes this guide on configuring nginx on an Ubuntu VPS.

Again, I'm clicking on links to the Apple App Store that end up with a little message that says that a particular bit of software is available in the US only. What?! It's software! It's not a film! I don't understand. Am I missing something obvious?

It's most often a pleasant surprise to me when I find out clever people are nice. Or nice people who are clever.

I think I've worked out what I want to do with the newsletter and the weekly post at Fading City. Until May next year, I'm going to carry on posting both the newsletter every day and a post every week. That makes ... eight months, or thereabouts. Then, I think, I'm going to change to posting a one-page PDF once a week on my own site, possibly with images. No more newsletter and no more weekly post after that. I think. That's the plan, anyway.
