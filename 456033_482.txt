Phew. We made it, didn't we? What's that smell?

"He once punched a colleague of mine full in the nose for writing something not entirely flattering about him. It did make him, yes, very hard to warm to, as he now seems to understand."

Where did I hear about this first? About Thomas Merton and buddhism? The Dalai Lama said of Merton: "more striking than his outward appearance which was memorable in itself, was the inner life which he manifested. I could see that he was a truly humble and deeply spiritual man. This was the first time I had been struck by such a feeling of spirituality by anyone who professed Christianity." ...

... "The anguish of the modern person, for Merton, was often based upon an addiction to a false self, one’s ego-mind, that only a realization of the no-self (Buddhism) or dying to one’s self (Christianity) could transform." ...

... "His body was flown back ... in a B-52 bomber, along with the bodies of American soldiers who had died in the Viet Nam War, a war he strongly opposed."

But, I still have no faith, nor do I feel the absence of it, nor do I wish for it.

Emily Yoshida: "Myst didn't stage a drama for those of us who played, it gave us a stage in which to go through our own little interior dramas, whether that was being inexplicably terrified to go down an unfamiliar corridor or inexplicably satisfied to discover a new vantage point of your surroundings that you hadn't known existed." ...

"The Slow Web would be more like a book, retaining many of the elements of the Popular Web, but unhurried, re-considered, additive. Research would no longer be restricted to rapid responders. Conclusions would be intentionally postponed until sufficiently noodled-with. Writers could budget sufficient dream-time before setting pixel to page. Fresh thinking would no longer have to happen in real time." This still sounds like old-school hypertext to me. And none the worse for that.

Have fun today.
