More redaction. Let's just say we did.

My 'new' slide rule! I should write something about this. I will, if I remember.

As I predicted, to anyone who might have listened, DuckDuckGo gets into the new business. Really rather good.

"Running Express.js in Production Mode ... be warned that should you run your app in production mode in any environment other than production, you are inviting 20 days and 21 nights of unfathomable pain." Hmm.

"What is LÖVE?" - you'll be singing that all day.

I have a terrific amount of email to reply to. I should get on that.
