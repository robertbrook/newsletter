Another Guess-Who. Born in Cairo, moved to Richmond after his father's illness. Good at cross-country running, left school at 16. Joined the army as an officer and worked in the 'Film and Photo Unit' in Italy. He took John Amery into custody - "Thank God you've come, I thought they were going to shoot me!" - and later filmed the aftermath of the death of Mussolini. During the Korean War, he was a journalist - and was mistakenly reported dead. Then - fame.

Onwards.
