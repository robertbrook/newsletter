I saw this. Sakamoto plays one piano 'analogue', duetting with a programmed piano. It was absolutely extraordinary. How can I ever be unhappy. I like the stripped-back keyboard.

My left knee is giving me trouble. Someone recommended acupuncture. I don't think I'm ready for that.

Laura Meseguer, designing the Magasin font: "At a certain point, I was not sure if it could become something usable or just a personal amusement; some connections were looking really weird but others just came automatically and in a very beautiful way."

If you've had to talk to me recently, I'm sorry I've been so down. I'm just a bit down.

Photographs by Bert Hardy. Iconic, but still beautiful. More at The Photographer's Gallery.

Now that Milk Bar has been translocated to Embassy East, I've retired back to Monmouth - the one on Monmouth Street. I remember the one by Borough Market when you could actually get a seat, but I've not been back for ages. I should check out Flat White again.

London's town halls: with photos and a map of the old metropolitan boroughs.

And I should take a trip to Brockley and Greenwich again. I hear things.

SuperintendÃªncia de Desportos do Estado do Rio de Janeiro - I imagine these folks are probably pretty busy already.

I'm at the stage where I'm just about going to force myself to start blogging again. And by blogging I mean a thousand word post a week.

"In Mi'kmaq the glyphs are called komqwejwi'kasikl, or 'sucker-fish writings', which refers to the tracks the sucker fish leaves on the muddy river bottom."

The coffee at Monmouth is great. Not exciting, not different, not even particularly interesting. But it's good, solid stuff. Week after week. Can't complain about that. And I don't think I've ever been served a dud. And this is the place that gave me the best macchiato I've ever drunk. In paper, of all things.

Still thinking about Google Plus.

"Hexels is a brand new, grid-based art program for Mac and PC that lets you paint with shapes." The isometric stuff in Hexel Pro looks wonderful.

I think someone just ordered a coffee called a "fluffy". But then my hearing's not what it was.

As mentioned recently on 'Back To Work': "a better way to create a strong, yet easy to remember passphrase for use with encryption and security programs."
