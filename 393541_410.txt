"No more be griev’d at that which thou hast done:
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense—
Thy adverse party is thy advocate—
And ’gainst myself a lawful plea commence.
Such civil war is in my love and hate,
That I an accessary needs must be
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me."

"Batch minify HTML, PHP, CSS and JavaScript on the Mac" - from Chen Luo.

I'm still hacking around in what used to be called Realbasic. I still don't like it, years after first using it. I've never liked Basic, or any variation of it. I should just bite the bullet of XCode - but, my goodness, what a learning curve. Maybe I should just go back to PHP - that's a nice place to hack around in.

That said: has anyone got a suggestion about something I could use to make Mac desktop applications that isn't XCode with Objective C? Or, if I should go with XCode, a tutorial for the basics? To me it feels like a great UI builder, then nothing underneath. Or, rather, Interface Builder and a big gap over C text.

"The human body is flexible and deformable, particularly the softer tissues. A hard slap on the face may briefly impose hundreds of g locally but not produce any real damage; a constant 16 g for a minute, however, may be deadly." Jeepers!

My body is not holding up particularly well at the moment. I'm sure it'll right itself over the next few weeks, but if you do see me hobbling about and wincing, do forgive any progress slower than usual. It's joints and muscles, I think.

Just to confirm: iTunes Radio is US-only, isn't it?
