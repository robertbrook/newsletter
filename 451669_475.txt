475 - LAMBETH BRIDGE - on the web (*|ARCHIVE|*)

Hello lovely internet people.

I'm not sure how do describe this. I did write it, though, I'm sure of that.

The rain has not stopped. It courses down.

Neil Gaiman: "Well-meaning adults can easily destroy a child's love of reading: stop them reading what they enjoy, or give them worthy-but-dull books that you like, the 21st-century equivalents of Victorian 'improving' literature." ... "We have an obligation to read aloud to our children. To read them things they enjoy. To read to them stories we are already tired of. To do the voices, to make it interesting, and not to stop reading to them just because they learn to read to themselves."

Francis Spufford, writing a decade ago, on the birth of 'Elite'. "Evidence began to trickle back to Acornsoft that people were exploring the bottled universe more obsessively even than the publishers had dared to hope: ... Word reached them that an intrepid explorer had, indeed, discovered a Planet Arse in one of the seven galaxies, which Bell and Braben hadn't checked for expletives." ... "Ian Bell ... used the rewards of Elite to study aikido and get into the rave scene. He breeds pedigree Burmese cats and worries about American imperialism and developing-world debt." Wonderful.

"The Reconstructed Heart: How to Spot the Difference Between a Normal Man and One Who Does the Housework, is Great in Bed and Doesn't Get All Iffy When You Mention Words Like Love and Commitment" is the title of a book.

I can't remember what podcast I heard it on, but someone reminded me that - oh, no, wait, it was Merlin - he made the point that Twitter was originally a way to tell a group of friends that you were going somewhere, or doing something. It wasn't supposed to be what it has become, a near-anonymised stream facing the world. Of course, they pivoted; or, you know, stuff.

Of course, it doesn't matter that Twitter isn't what it was - but that original scratch remains substantially un-itched. Then I think, what about email? Email still exists. I could just use email to communicate with people. So you should expect replies to emails, from me, I think.

Have fun.
