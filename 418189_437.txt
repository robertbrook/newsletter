"TPC-H is an ad-hoc, decision support benchmark." Something about testing databases?

My Little Printer experiment fell over, but I picked it up again. I do still like Little Printer.

I am listening to Black Dog, like in the olden times.

"In 1931 a crude casket was unearthed during an archaeological investigation of the site. The remains were studied and pronounced consistent with the injuries received by St Edward. The Director of the Excavations, John Wilson-Claridge (1905-1993), whose family then owned the site, began years of painstaking negotiations with all the major churches in order to find a suitable resting place for the relics. He imposed three conditions: (1) that they were recognised as the relics of a saint, (2) that a shrine would be established for their reception, and (3) that his feast days would be observed. These conditions were met only by the Russian Orthodox Church in Exile, which entered into detailed negotiations with Mr Wilson-Claridge in the late 1970s."

"She was asked to go over Hilbertâ€™s papers and correct all the mistakes. She labored for three years and corrected all the mistakes she could, without any major changes in the statement of the theorems. There was one exception: a paper Hilbert wrote in his old age which could not be fixed. It was a purported proof of the continuum hypothesis."

Gian-Carlo Rota, 'Ten Lessons I Wish I Had Been Taught': "There are two kinds of mistakes. There are fatal mistakes that destroy a theory, but there are also contingent ones, which are useful in testing the stability of a theory." On age: "You must realize that after reach- ing a certain age you are no longer viewed as a person. You become an institution, and you are treated the way institutions are treated. You are expected to behave like a piece of period furniture, an architectural landmark, or an incunabulum."
