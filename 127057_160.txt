A lot of the time I think about how I might avoid doing something awful. Perhaps it's also time for me to listen to the people, the kind people, who remind me that I might also think about how I should properly use my voice. I do, yes, have a little voice. And I do, yes, have my own voice. That's all I claim for it - and all I should.

It's a bit like a diet. Concentrate more on what I should be eating a less on what I shouldn't.

For the last few years I've been thinking about encouragement, support and 'pointing out'. Noticing, possibly. These are things I think I might be capable of doing and things that should have a good outcome. Also, 'celebration'. I see a lot of things I think are worthy of celebration.

So why haven't I actually done this? I mean, why have I been stuck at the thinking about it stage? Well, nervousness, that's part of it. And a deal of worrying that I come across as pretty creepy, or at least I can, or might. What I no longer worry about it looking silly. I don't really mind looking silly. Any more. I've grown out of worrying about looking silly.

I admire people I think are 'cool'. They have interesting lives and say interesting things. They have experiences before I do, or have experience I never would. They write wonderfully and take photos and say funny things on Twitter. I do admire them. But I don't find them approachable, really. And I don't mean 'cool' in a derogatory sense, more in a late 80s, early 90s sense. Back when cool was cool.

The odd thing is, some of the cool people are actually nice people as well. In fact, there's not a one of them I've met who didn't turn out to be great company. I'm not sure why I thought ever they wouldn't be.

They key, for me, is to notice when I'm happy and work back from there. I'm happy, so, what was I doing? And I'll not squirm out of it and say 'content' only, but actually happy. Most of it for me now is flow state. When things are going okay, going well. Moving along. That's as close as I get to happy. I'm still often too nervous with other people to say I'm happy in company.
