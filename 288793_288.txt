Lumacoustics: digital walls, surfaces, 'Augmented Reality Dance Experience' and a sort of mirror-thing. I think I need a lie down.

A mallard tells me: "You are not entitled to your opinion. You are only entitled to what you can defend." I think this over-simplifies things. I was going to write something more about that but I'm simply too tired to argue about it now.
