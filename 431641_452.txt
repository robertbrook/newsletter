Exercise Clockwork, 2011: "The following morning, everyone had to undergo the dreaded Ice Breaking drills. This involves each individual jumping into a frozen lake with your Bergen packed with dry clothes inside ...

After this you must use your ski poles to help dig in to the ice in a dagger motion to drag yourself out of the water." ...

"Why do we see an awful lot of data stored in static files in CSV or JSON format, even though they are hard to query and update incrementally?"

"... a basic Todo web application based on TodoMVC that syncs to an online CouchDB server." - with PouchDB, "written to help web developers build applications that work as well offline as well as they do online ..."
