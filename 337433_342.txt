I wrote a short history of Broadstairs.

"I learned in my youth, ... that it is better to choose short words when I can. I should not choose long, hard words just to make other persons think that I know a lot. I should try to make my thoughts clear; if they are clear and right, then other persons can judge my work as it ought to be judged." Guy L. Steele, 'Growing a language', October 1998

An 'abstract map' of London.

Including an image of a 'Third class coffin ticket'.

The prospect of there actually having been a 'Croydon Central' station baffled me for years. I used to go to the old Croydon Central Library, to refer to microfilms and fiches - and regularly went through what is now called Queen's Gardens. It often had a floral clock. For some time I really did think people were having me on about there being a station there, but all evidence points towards it being true. It still, for some reason, strikes me as almost absurd.

"This site provides three historical series pertaining to the average worker in the United Kingdom." Fascinating. The results are presented as columns of text. Wouldn't it be great to have even simple graphs generated?

"During [World War II] the West London Line was severely damaged by enemy action on 20th October 1940 and Battersea Station closed with the line on that day having been hit by incendiary bombs and damaged by fire. The closure was only supposed to be temporary but in July 1943 the platform decking was removed for reuse elsewhere and the station never reopened."

A striking image of the Goodwin Sands light-ship. "LV90 was swept onto the sands in Keller Gut and immediately capsized under the pounding from the waves. Her crew sought refuge in the galley and were trapped there when the ship capsized. One man, Ronald Murton, climbed out of the galley skylight and clung to the hull." Only Ronald Murton survived.
